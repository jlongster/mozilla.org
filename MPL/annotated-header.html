  NETSCAPE PUBLIC LICENSE, Annotated</FONT></B></P>

<P>
Below are two documents.  On the left is the Netscape Public License,
a legal document.  On the right is an attempt to explain what the 
license means in informal language.  (The links in the license itself
point to the appropriate section in the explanation list.)

<P>
Note that <I>these explanations are not the license.</I>
The explanations are not a legal document, or legal advice.  
If you need to know <I>exactly</I> what the license requires, you
need to read and understand the license itself; if you need legal
advice, you need to talk to a lawyer.  The annotations are merely
a good faith effort to explain the license in simpler language.
