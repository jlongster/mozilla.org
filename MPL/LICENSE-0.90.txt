     The Initial Developer hereby grants, to each person who complies with
     the terms of this License, a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive
     license to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and
     distribute the Original Code either as Original Code, with or without
     Modifications, or as a Larger Work.

     2.2. Contributor Grant.
     Each Contributor hereby grants, to each person who complies with the
     terms of this License, a world-wide, royalty-free non-exclusive license
     to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute
     the Modifications created by such Contributor either on an unmodified
     basis, with Modifications, as a Covered Work or as a Larger Work.

     case may be, which are required in order to practice the inventions in
     the Covered Work.

     2.4. Netscape and logo.
     This License does not grant any rights to use the trademark
     ``Netscape'' or the Netscape ``N and horizon'' logo, even if such marks
     are included in the Original Code.

3. Distribution Obligations.

     3.1. Application of License.
     The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
     governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
     Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Works may be
     distributed only under the terms of this License, and You must include
     a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
     distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
     version that alters or restricts this License or the recipients' rights
     hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the
     additional rights described in Section 3.5.

     3.2. Public Availability of Source Code.
     Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must (a)
     be made publicly available in Source Code form under the terms of this
     License via a mechanism generally accepted in the software development
     community for the electronic transfer of data (a current example is
     transmission via the file transfer protocol) (``Electronic Transfer
     Mechanism''); and (b) remain publicly available via an Electronic
     Transfer Mechanism for at least twelve (12) months after the date it
     initially became publicly available, or at least six (6) months after a
     subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made
     publicly available. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source
     Code version remains available even if the Electronic Transfer
     Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

     3.3. Description of Modifications.
     You must cause each Covered Work to contain a file documenting the
     changes You made to the Original Code or subsequent Modifications and
     the date of any change. You must also include, in every location in the
     Source Code, executable version, and in related documentation where You
     describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Work, a notice visible
     to the end user and prominently stating that the Modification is
     derived from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and
     including the name of the Initial Developer.

     3.4. Existing Third Party Claims.
     You will not include functionality or code in any Covered Work if You
     have actual knowledge that such functionality or code (or its use under
     this License) is subject to intellectual property rights of third
     parties, unless You have obtained royalty free rights for all licenses
     and licensees under this License to use such functionality or code. If
     You have actual knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property
     right in particular functionality or code but you do not believe such a
     claim is valid, You may include such functionality or code, provided
     that you must include a file with the source code distribution titled
     ``Legal'' which describes the claim and the party making the claim in
     sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact.

     3.5. Required Notices.
     You must duplicate the notice in Attachment A in the Source Code, and
     the notices in Sections 7, 9, and 10 in any documentation for the
     Source Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered
     Work. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, additional
     warranty, support, indemnity or liability rights to one or more
     recipients of the Original Code, Modification or Modified Code.
     However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of
     the Initial Developer or any other Contributor. You must make it
     absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or
     liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to
     indemnify the Initial Developer and every other Contributor for any
     liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a
     result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability offers You make.

     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
     You may distribute a Covered Work in executable form only if the
     requirements of Section 3 have been met for that Covered Work, and if
     You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the
     Covered Work is available under the terms of this License, including a
     description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of
     Section 3.2. The notice must be included in all locations in the Source
     Code, documentation and executable versions in which You describe
     recipients' rights relating to the Covered Work. You may distribute the
     executable version of a Covered Work under a license of Your choice,
     which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You
     are in compliance with the terms of this License. If You distribute the
     executable version under a different license You must make it
     absolutely clear than any terms which differ from this License are
     offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any other
     Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
     every other Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
     Developer or such Contributor as a result of such terms You offer.

     3.7. Larger Works.
     You may combine a Covered Work with other code not governed by the
     terms of this License and distribute the combination as a single
     product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this
     License are fulfilled for the Covered Work.

4. Inability to Comply.

     4.1. Due to Law or Regulation.
     If it is impossible for You to comply with the terms of this License
     with respect to some or all of the Covered Work due to statute or
     regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to
     the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the
     code they affect. Such description must be included in the Legal file
     described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of
     the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by law or regulation,
     such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of
     ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

     4.2. Due to Contractual Obligation.
     Prior to licensing the Original Code under this License, the Initial
     Developer has licensed third party code for use in the Initial
     Developer's Branded Code. To the extent that the Initial Developer is
     limited contractually from making such third party code available under
     this License, the Initial Developer will exclude such third party code
     from Covered Works.

5. Use of Modifications and Modified Code by Initial Developer.

     5.1. In General.
     The obligations of Section 3 apply to the Initial Developer, except to
     the extent specified in Section 5.2 and 5.3.

     5.2. Other Products.
     Initial Developer may include Covered Works in products other than the
     Initial Developer's Branded Code, without such additional products
     becoming subject to the terms of this License, and may license such
     additional products on different terms from those contained in this
     License.

     5.3. Alternative Licensing.
     Initial Developer may license the Source Code of Initial Developer's
     Branded Code, including Modifications incorporated therein, to third
     parties under different terms from those contained in this License.

6. Versions of the License.

     6.1. By Initial Developer.
     The Initial Developer may publish revised and/or new versions of the
     License from time to time, which shall be applicable to Covered Works
     made publicly available after the date of the new license. Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to this License, but may differ to
     address problems or concerns. Each version will be given a
     distinguishing version number. No one other than Initial Developer has
     the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Works created under
     this License.

     6.2. For New Code.
     If You wish to act as the Initial Developer for code which is not
     already a Covered Work (``New Code''), You may use this document and
     list Yourself as the Initial Developer and Your New Code as Original
     Code at the top of this document. You may also modify this License and
     use a modified version of this License for Your New Code. However, if
     You modify this License other than by changing the name of the Initial
     Developer and Original Code, You must rename Your license so that it is
     clear that Your version of the license has been modified (for example,
     ``Modified Netscape Public License -- [Your Name]'' or ``[Your Name]
     Public License'').

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

     THE COVERED WORKS ARE PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ``AS IS''
     BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
     INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED WORKS ARE
     FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
     NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
     THE COVERED WORKS IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED WORK PROVE DEFECTIVE
     IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER
     CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
     CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART
     OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED WORK IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER
     EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION.

     This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
     such breach within 30 days. All sublicenses to the Covered Works which
     are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License.
     Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
     termination of this License shall survive.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL
     DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF A COVERED WORK,
     OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER
     PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
     OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF
     GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND
     ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE
     BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
     LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
     RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
     PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
     EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT
     EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

     Each Covered Work is a ``commercial item,'' as that term is defined in
     48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ``commercial computer
     software'' and ``commercial computer software documentation,'' as such
     terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
     C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
     all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Works with only those
     rights set forth herein.

11. MISCELLANEOUS.

     This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
     matter hereof and may be amended only by a writing executed by both
     parties. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable,
     such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make
     it enforceable. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, all disputes
     relating to this License (excepting any dispute relating to
     intellectual property rights) shall be subject to final and binding
     arbitration in Santa Clara County, California, under the auspices of
     JAMS/EndDispute, with the losing party paying all costs of arbitration.
     This License shall be governed by California law, excluding conflict of
     law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides
     otherwise). The application of the United Nations Convention on
     Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.

12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS.
