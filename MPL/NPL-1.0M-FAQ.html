<p><b>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why did we make changes to the license agreement?</b>
<ul>To encourage greater adoption, correct bugs in the license, add a multiple
license feature, and incorporate other comments from the development community.
Broadly speaking, we've made changes to the license in three areas with
the overall goal of making alterations that encourage more people and groups
to join us in the open source development effort.&nbsp; These three areas
are:
<p><b>a. </b>Changes to the sections dealing with the granting of intellectual
property rights.&nbsp; Here we've tried to:
<ul>
<li>
More narrowly and precisely define the IP grants made by contributors to
the Mozilla code base</li>

<li>
Provide a defensive mechanism in case a contributor is sued for patent
infringement by someone who is benefiting from NPL code that contributor
wrote.</li>
</ul>
<b>b. </b>A change to the license framework that allows an Initial Developer
to permit code to be used under multiple licenses.
<br><b>c.</b> Incorporation of other comments we've received from the development
community over the past 11 months.</ul>
<b>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do the changes apply to both the NPL and the MPL?</b>
<ul>Yes, the proposed changes are applicable to both the NPL and the MPL.</ul>
<b>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why did you change the patent license grants in
Section 2.1(b) and 2.2(b)?</b>
<ul>Some developers, most notably some large institutions and public companies,
were concerned that participation could cause them to grant patent rights
beyond the Mozilla code base and beyond the scope of their contribution.&nbsp;
This limited their ability to participate.</ul>
<b>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What patent licenses are now granted in proposed
Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b)?</b>
<ul>When someone contributes code under the license, they are granting
rights to their modifications alone and to the combination of their modifications
with the version of code they created.</ul>
<b>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What patent licenses are not granted in proposed
Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b)?</b>
<ul><b>a. </b>Rights to the combination of&nbsp; modifications with software
or hardware other than the version of code the contributor created.
<br><b>b. </b>The right to license a patent right alone, removed from the
NPL code.
<br><b>c. </b>Rights to subsequent modifications.</ul>
<b>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do Sections 8.2, 8.3, and 8.4 work?</b>
<ul>The rationale is that someone should not be able to benefit from your
contribution to the Mozilla code base and also sue you for patent infringement.&nbsp;
So this section allows you to revoke that person's rights to use the code
you contributed to Mozilla or to receive payment for your contribution.&nbsp;
In addition, if someone sues you for patent infringement for code that's
not in the Mozilla code base, you can revoke the&nbsp; patent grant you
made to that person under the NPL.&nbsp; This allows you to use such patent
rights defensively to respond to a claim made against you.</ul>
<b>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why did you add the concept of "Commercial Use"
to the license?</b>
<ul>This is a mechanism to allow a developer to experiment with NPL code
and make modifications in private without having to grant&nbsp; patent
rights.&nbsp; Patent rights would be granted if and when the developer
decides to release the code to others or use the code for purposes other
than research and development.</ul>
<b>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What does the Multiple License clause mean?</b>
<ul>This clause gives an initial developer the ability to release code
under more than one license.&nbsp; For example, an initial developer of
a new module has the option to license it under the MPL as well as the
GPL.</ul>
<b>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is this right limited to the initial developer?</b>
<ul>This is to ensure that someone downstream from the initial developer
is not able to take the initial developer's code, make minor modifications,
and then release the new version under multiple licenses without the initial
developer's consent.</ul>
<b>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are developers who modify the code also required
to release their modifications under multiple licenses?</b>
<ul>No.&nbsp; However, we strongly encourage this, because in this way
the maximum number of people can receive the benefits of the modification.</ul>
<b>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will Netscape be releasing any code under multiple
licenses?</b>
<ul>Yes.&nbsp; Netscape will be releasing its interpreter for the JavaScript
language under the NPL as well as the GPL.</ul>
<b>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you discussed this with the open/free source
community?</b>
<ul>Yes we have, and we've received the following from Richard Stallman:
<p>"On behalf of the GNU Project, I would like to thank Netscape for making
the interpreter for the JavaScript language available under the terms of
the GNU GPL as well as under the NPL.&nbsp; I would like to ask all programmers
who make changes in this interpreter to give Netscape their fullest cooperation
in mutual use of these changes, and to release these changes under the
NPL as well as the GPL."</ul>
<b>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isn't there a danger that the code under
the two licenses will branch and the two implementations will be at odds?</b>
<ul>There is this danger, but in conversations with the GPL development
community, we have agreed that we all have interests in seeing this experiment
succeed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, we are jointly encouraging anyone doing
development on the codebase for the JavaScript language to release modifications
under the NPL as well as the GPL.</ul>
<b>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What does "contributes to the creation of" mean
in the definition of Contributor in Section 1.1?</b>
<ul>Although this is not a change to the prior version, there were questions
about this language.&nbsp; The intent is to prevent someone from avoiding
the license requirements by technicalities. For example, two developers
are sitting at a machine jointly creating modifications to NPL code, although
only one person is actually typing the code.&nbsp; In this case, both developers
should be considered contributors.&nbsp; On the other hand, if a person
posts some ideas on a website relating to a modification of NPL Code, and
another developer, not working in concert with the first developer, actually
develops the proposed modifications, the first person did not "contribute
to the creation of the modification" within the meaning of the NPL.</ul>
