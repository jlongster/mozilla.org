  <h2 id="about-this-faq">About This FAQ</h2>

  <p>This is the Mozilla Public License (MPL) version 2.0 FAQ. It aims to
  answer the most common questions people have about using and distributing
  code under the MPL.</p>

  <p>Please note that, while this FAQ is intended to be accurate and helpful,
  it <em>is not the license</em>, and may not cover important issues that
  affect you and your specific situation. As a result, reading the FAQ should
  not serve as a substitute for reading the license itself, or for seeking
  legal advice from a lawyer.</p>

  <p>If you see any errors in this FAQ, or have suggestions for further
  questions, please email <a href="mailto:licensing@mozilla.org">licensing@mozilla.org</a>.</p>

  <p>The MPL version 1.1 FAQ is still available <a href=
  "../1.1/FAQ.html">here</a> but should not be used
  except as a reference for that license.</p>

  <h2 id="about-mpl">About MPL</h2>

  <h3 id="what-is-the-mpl"><a href="#what-is-the-mpl" class="headerlink">
  Q1: What is the Mozilla Public
  License?
  </a></h3>

  <p>The MPL is a simple <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft">copyleft</a> license. The MPL's
  "file-level" copyleft is designed to encourage contributors to share
  modifications they make to your code, while still allowing them to combine
  your code with code under other licenses (open or proprietary) with minimal
  restrictions.</p>

  <h3 id="why-another-license"><a href="#why-another-license" class="headerlink">
  Q2: Why yet another open source license?
  </a></h3>

  <p>The MPL fills a useful space in the spectrum of free and open source
  software licenses, sitting between the Apache license, which does not
  require modifications to be shared, and the GNU family of licenses, which
  requires modifications to be shared under a much broader set of
  circumstances than the MPL.</p>

  <h3 id="maintainers"><a href="#maintainers" class="headerlink">
  Q3: Who maintains the MPL?
  </a></h3>

  <p>The MPL is maintained by the Mozilla project, a global non-profit
  community dedicated to building openness, interoperability and individual
  empowerment into the Internet. The Mozilla project operates under a system
  of distributed authority known a the Module Ownership System. Like other
  Mozilla modules, the MPL has a module owner and peers who are responsible
  for maintaining the license. The current owner and peers are listed
  <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Module_Owners_Activities_Modules#Mozilla_Public_License_Module">
  at the Module Owners page</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="license-use">Using and Distributing Software Under the License</h2>
<h3 id="apply"><a href="#apply" class="headerlink">
  Q4: I want to use the Mozilla Public License for software that I have written. What do I have
  to do?
  </a></h3>

  <p>To apply the Mozilla Public License to software that you have written, add the header from Exhibit A of the license to each source code file in your project. Sample headers for various commenting styles are available <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/headers/">here.</a> You may also add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership, such as the name of the copyright holder, but this is not necessary.</p>

  <h3 id="use"><a href="#use" class="headerlink">
  Q5: I want to use software which is available under the MPL. What do I have
  to do?
  </a></h3>

  <p>Nothing. Like all other free and open source software, software
  available under the MPL is available for anyone (including individuals and
  companies) to use for any purpose. The MPL only creates obligations for you
  if you want to distribute the software outside your organization.</p>

  <h3 id="distribute-within-organization"><a href="#distribute-within-organization" class="headerlink">
  Q6: I want to distribute software which is available under the MPL, either
  changed or unchanged, within my organization. What do I have to do?
  </a></h3>

  <p>Nothing. The right to private modification and distribution (and inside
  a company or organization counts as 'private') is another right guaranteed
  by free and open source software licenses, including the MPL.</p>

  <h3 id="distribute-other-peoples-binaries"><a href="#distribute-other-peoples-binaries" class="headerlink">
  Q7: I want to distribute (outside my organization) complete and unchanged
  executable programs built from MPL-licensed software by someone other than
  me. What do I have to do?
  </a></h3>

  <p>As long as the people who distributed the program to you have complied
  with the MPL, typically nothing. To check and see if the people who
  distributed the program to you have complied with the MPL, look for the
  notice that tells you where the software is available in Source Code form
  (i.e., check that it complies with Section 3.2(a)), and then check that the
  Source Code is available in that place, including a notice that informs you
  that the Source Code is available under the terms of the MPL (i.e., check
  that it complies with Section 3.1).</p>

  <p>In the case of Mozilla Firefox, the Mozilla-provided executable programs
  already meet the requirements of Section 3, including the notices required
  by Section 3.1 and 3.2.</p>

  <p>If you want to add your own terms when you distribute the software,
  Section 3.2(b) requires that those terms must not restrict a recipient's
  rights under the MPL, and if you offer a warranty on the software, Section
  3.5 requires you to make clear that it is offered by you alone.</p>

  <h3 id="distribute-my-binaries"><a href="#distribute-my-binaries" class="headerlink">
  Q8: I want to distribute (outside my organization) executable programs that
  I have compiled from someone else's unchanged MPL-licensed source code.
  What do I have to do?
  </a></h3>

  <p>You must inform the recipients where they can get the source for the
  executable program you are distributing (i.e., you must comply with Section
  3.2). You may also distribute any executables you create under a license of
  your choosing, as long as that license does not interfere with the
  recipients' rights to the source under the terms of the MPL.</p>

  <h3 id="distribute-modified-source"><a href="#distribute-modified-source" class="headerlink">
  Q9: I want to distribute (outside my organization) MPL-licensed source code
  that I have modified. What do I have to do?
  </a></h3>

  <p>To see the complete set of requirements, read the license. However,
  generally:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>You must inform the recipients that the source code is made
      available to them under the terms of the MPL (Section 3.1), including
      any Modifications (as defined in Section 1.10) that you have
      created.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>You must make the grants described in Section 2 of the license.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>You must respect the restrictions on removing or altering notices in the source code (Section 3.4).</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="distribute-binaries-from-modified-source"><a href="#distribute-binaries-from-modified-source" class="headerlink">
  Q10: I want to distribute (outside my organization) an executable program
  based on MPL-licensed source code that I have modified. What do I have to
  do?
  </a></h3>

  <p>You must make available the MPL-licensed portions of the source code as
  described in the previous question, and inform the recipients how they can
  obtain such source code (Section 3.2).</p>

  <h2 id="other-common-questions">Other Common Questions</h2>

  <h3 id="virality"><a href="#virality" class="headerlink">
  Q11: How 'viral' is the MPL? If I use MPL-licensed code in my proprietary
  application, will I have to give all the source code away?
  </a></h3>

  <p>No. The license requires that Modifications (as defined in Section 1.10
  of the license) must be licensed under the MPL and made available to anyone
  to whom you distribute the Source Code. However, new files containing no
  MPL-licensed code are not Modifications, and therefore do not need to be
  distributed under the terms of the MPL, even if you create a Larger Work (as defined in Section 1.7) by using, compiling, or
  distributing the non-MPL files together with MPL-licensed files. This allows, for example,
  programs using MPL-licensed code to be statically linked to and distributed as part of a larger
  proprietary piece of software, which would not generally be possible under
  the terms of stronger copyleft licenses.</p>

  <h3 id="copyleft-scope"><a href="#copyleft-scope" class="headerlink">
  Q12: How does the scope of the MPL's copyleft compare with the LGPL and GPL's
  copyleft?
  </a></h3>

  <p>Broadly speaking, the scope of the MPL, LGPL, and GPL can be summarized
  this way:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>MPL: The copyleft applies to any files containing MPLed code.
  <li>LGPL: The copyleft applies to any library based on LGPLed code.
  <li>GPL: The copyleft applies to all software based on GPLed code.
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p>However, we would recommend reading the licenses to better understand
  their scope, and in particular, to understand how the LGPL and GPL define
  "based on."</p>

  <h3 id="mpl-bsd-and-apache"><a href="#mpl-bsd-and-apache" class="headerlink">
  Q13: May I combine MPL-licensed code and BSD-licensed code in the same
  executable program? What about Apache?
  </a></h3>

  <p>Yes to both. Mozilla currently does this with BSD-licensed code. For
  example, libvpx, which is used in Firefox to decode WebM video, is under a
  BSD license.</p>

  <h3 id="mpl-and-lgpl"><a href="#mpl-and-lgpl" class="headerlink">
  Q14: May I combine MPL-licensed code and (L)GPL-licensed code in the same
  executable program?
  </a></h3>

  <p>Yes, by creating a "Larger Work" under the terms of Section 3.3. In
  particular, three requirements must be met:</p>

  <ol type="1">
    <li>
      <p>The software must not be “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses.” 
      Software can become “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses” in one of 
      two ways: the original author
      marks it as such by adding the file header in Exhibit B, or the
      original author published the software under MPL 1.1 and did not dual-
      or tri-license the code with the (L)GPL.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>The Larger Work must be "a <strong>combination</strong> of Covered
      Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses." So you can't
      just say "I really prefer (L)GPL" - you must have a need to combine
      with another, existing GPL work. (This is different from a traditional
      dual-license, which does not require you to combine, and instead allows you to simply
      say "I've decided to be GPL-only.")</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>You must "<strong>additionally</strong> distribute" under (L)GPL. In
      other words, you must make the MPL-licensed source code
      available to your recipients under both MPL and (L)GPL. Someone
      downstream from your recipients can then take under (L)GPL-only or
      MPL-only. This is different from a traditional dual-license, which
      never requires publication under both licenses, and so always gives you
      the option of releasing incompatibly-licensed code.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>No GPL-compatible license can perfectly preserve the original author's
  ability to reuse downstream derivatives, but the last two restrictions
  serve to increase the probability that such reuse can occur in the broadest
  possible set of circumstances.</p>

  <h3 id="license-proliferation"><a href="#license-proliferation" class="headerlink">
  Q15: Does Sec. 3.3's ability to mix with other licenses lead to more license
  proliferation?
  </a></h3>

  <p>Mozilla's experience with MPL 1.1, and the experience of some of our
  advisors, was that in practice license incompatibility is often resolved by
  the use of custom additional permissions or dual- and tri- licenses. Each
  combination of dual or tri-license, or custom additional permissions,
  further complicates license interaction and proliferation analysis. We feel
  that Sec. 3.3, by replacing these ad-hoc solutions with a single,
  standardized solution for the most common situation, should reduce, rather than increase, the
  practical risk of license proliferation.</p>

  <h3 id="minified-js"><a href="#minified-js" class="headerlink">
  Q16: Is "minified" JavaScript Source Code?
  </a></h3>

  <p>No. <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minification_%28programming%29">Minified</a> JavaScript, while not an "executable" in the software
  engineering sense of the word, is difficult for humans to read, edit, and
  modify. As such, it is not "the preferred form for modification" and so it
  is not Source Code as defined by the license. Therefore, minified
  JavaScript is the Executable form, and the responsibilities set out in the
  license for distribution of the Executable form should be met when you
  distribute minified MPL-licensed JavaScript.</p>

  <p>Note that treating minified JavaScript as an executable
  <em>increases</em> distributor flexibility by allowing MPL-licensed code to
  be combined into a single file with non-MPL JavaScript source code without
  requiring the non-MPL code to be distributed under the terms of the
  MPL.</p>

  <h3 id="what-does-distribute-mean"><a href="#what-does-distribute-mean" class="headerlink">
  Q17: What does "distribute" mean?
  </a></h3>

  <p>The MPL uses "distribute" in the sense of delivery of a copy of the
  software to another person or entity. We do not use distribute to mean
  "make available" in the sense of "making functionality available over the
  web without delivery of a copy of the software." So e.g. in a
  web-based application, the code which runs on the server is not
  'distributed' to the user, but the code which is sent to the client
  (e.g. HTML, CSS, JavaScript) does count as 'distributed'.</p>

  <h3 id="non-software-works"><a href="#non-software-works" class="headerlink">
  Q18: Should MPL be used for non-software works?
  </a></h3>

  <p>MPL was written with software in mind, and should generally only be used
  for software. However, for consistency and simplicity, it may be
  appropriate to use the MPL for non-software works (such as documentation,
  images, and sound files) that are written primarily for use in MPL-licensed
  software.</p>

  <h3 id="changing-notices"><a href="#changing-notices" class="headerlink">
  Q19: Can I remove or change notice statements which are displayed by a piece
  of software?
  </a></h3>

  <p>Section 3.4 prohibits most changes to license notices that are seen when 
  looking at the source code. We do not encourage
  changing licensing and notice statements which are displayed when the
  software is executed. However, such changes are permitted by the license,
  so that source code can be reused between software with very different user
  interfaces.</p>

  <h3 id="ownership"><a href="#ownership" class="headerlink">
  Q20: I've downloaded a copy of some MPL software. Am I an "owner" of that
  software for purposes of Section 1.1?
  </a></h3>

  <p>No. Merely downloading the software does not make you an owner for the
  purposes of Section 1.1.</p>

  <h3 id="making-my-own-license"><a href="#making-my-own-license" class="headerlink">
  Q21: Does the MPL 2 give me permission to make my own license by changing the
  MPL?
  </a></h3>

  <p>Yes but, as with MPL 1.1, <strong>we strongly discourage you from doing
  so</strong>. It will almost certainly make your software much less popular
  and less widely used. Software developers and companies are already aware
  of and understand popular licenses like the MPL. If you create your own,
  they will have to perform a legal assessment of your changes - and may
  conclude it's not worth the effort to do so. Or, you may accidentally make
  your software incompatible with the Free Software Definition or the Open
  Source Definition, or with the other commonly-used free software licenses
  that MPL 2 is compatible with.</p>

  <p>If you like the MPL 2, just use it as-is - it is a clear, modern,
  internationalized, generic license. There is nothing Mozilla-specific, or
  specific to a particular country or project, in its licensing terms.</p>

  <p>For more information on the problems that creating your own license
  causes, see the Wikipedia article on <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License_proliferation">license
  proliferation</a>.</p>
