    <P><B>2.2.  Contributor Grant.</B><BR>

    Each Contributor hereby grants, to each person who complies with

    license to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and
    distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor either on

</UL>
<P><B>3. Distribution Obligations.</B>
<UL>

    <P><B>3.1.   Application of License.</B><BR>

    The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
    governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
    Section <B>2.2</B>.  The Source Code version of Covered Works may be
    distributed only under the terms of this License, and You must
    include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code
    You distribute.  You may not offer or impose any terms on any
    Source Code version that alters or restricts this License or the
    recipients' rights hereunder.  However, You may include an
    additional document offering the additional rights described in
    Section <B>3.5</B>.

    <P><B>3.2.  <A HREF="annotations-0.90.html#Public_Availability_of_Source_Code" TARGET="annotations">Public Availability of Source Code</A>.</B><BR>

    Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must
    (a) be made publicly available in Source Code form under the terms
    of this License via a mechanism generally accepted in the software
    development community for the electronic transfer of data (a
    current example is transmission via the file transfer protocol)
    (``Electronic Transfer Mechanism''); and (b) remain publicly
    available via an Electronic Transfer Mechanism for at least twelve
    (12) months after the date it initially became publicly available,
    or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that
    particular Modification has been made publicly available.  You are
    responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains
    available even if the Electronic Transfer Mechanism is maintained
    by a third party.

    <P><B>3.3.   Description of Modifications.</B><BR>

    You must cause each Covered Work to contain a file documenting the
    changes You made to the Original Code or subsequent Modifications
    and the date of any change.  You must also include, in every
    location in the Source Code, executable version, and in related
    documentation where You describe the origin or ownership of the
    Covered Work, a notice visible to the end user and prominently
    stating that the Modification is derived from Original Code
    provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
    Initial Developer.

    <P><B>3.4.   <A HREF="annotations-0.90.html#Existing_Third_Party_Claims" TARGET="annotations">Existing Third Party Claims</A>.</B><BR>

    You will not include functionality or code in any Covered Work if
    You have actual knowledge that such functionality or code (or its
    use under this License) is subject to intellectual property rights
    of third parties, unless You have obtained royalty free rights for
    all licenses and licensees under this License to use such
    functionality or code. If You have actual knowledge that a party
    claims an intellectual property right in particular functionality
    or code but you do not believe such a claim is valid, You may
    include such functionality or code, provided that you must include
    a file with the source code distribution titled ``Legal'' which
    describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient
    detail that a recipient will know whom to contact.

    <P><B>3.5.   <A HREF="annotations-0.90.html#Required_Notices" TARGET="annotations">Required Notices</A>.</B><BR>

    You must duplicate the notice in Attachment A in the Source Code,
    and the notices in Sections <B>7</B>, <B>9</B>, and <B>10</B> in
    any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe
    recipients' rights relating to Covered Work.  You may choose to
    offer, and to charge a fee for, additional warranty, support,
    indemnity or liability rights to one or more recipients of the
    Original Code, Modification or Modified Code.  However, You may do
    so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
    Developer or any other Contributor.  You must make it absolutely
    clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability
    obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to
    indemnify the Initial Developer and every other Contributor for any
    liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as
    a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability offers You
    make.

    <P><B>3.6.  <A HREF="annotations-0.90.html#Distribution_of_Executable_Versions" TARGET="annotations">Distribution of Executable Versions</A>.</B><BR>

    You may distribute a Covered Work in executable form only if the
    requirements of Section <B>3</B> have been met for that Covered Work, and
    if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the
    Covered Work is available under the terms of this License,
    including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
    obligations of Section <B>3.2</B>.  The notice must be included in all
    locations in the Source Code, documentation and executable versions
    in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered
    Work.  You may distribute the executable version of a Covered Work
    under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different
    from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the
    terms of this License.  If You distribute the executable version
    under a different license You must make it absolutely clear than
    any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone,
    not by the Initial Developer or any other Contributor. You hereby
    agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every other
    Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or
    such Contributor as a result of such terms You offer.

    <P><B>3.7.  Larger Works.</B><BR>

    You may combine a Covered Work with other code not governed by the
    terms of this License and distribute the combination as a single
    product.  In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of
    this License are fulfilled for the Covered Work.

</UL>
<P><B>4.  Inability to Comply.</B>
<UL>

    <P><B>4.1.    <A HREF="annotations-0.90.html#Due_to_Law_or_Regulation" TARGET="annotations">Due to Law or Regulation</A>.</B><BR>

    If it is impossible for You to comply with the terms of this
    License with respect to some or all of the Covered Work due to
    statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of
    this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
    limitations and the code they affect.  Such description must be
    included in the Legal file described in Section <B>3.4</B> and must be
    included with all distributions of the Source Code.  Except to the
    extent prohibited by law or regulation, such description must be
    sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able
    to understand it.

    <P><B>4.2.  Due to Contractual Obligation.</B><BR>

    Prior to licensing the Original Code under this License, the
    Initial Developer has licensed third party code for use in the
    Initial Developer's Branded Code.  To the extent that the Initial
    Developer is limited contractually from making such third party
    code available under this License, the Initial Developer will
    exclude such third party code from Covered Works.

</UL>
<P><B>5.  Use of Modifications and Modified Code by Initial Developer.</B>
<UL>

    <P><B>5.1.  In General.</B><BR>

    The obligations of Section <B>3</B> apply to the Initial Developer, except
    to the extent specified in Section <B>5.2</B> and <B>5.3</B>.

    <P><B>5.2.  <A HREF="annotations-0.90.html#Other_Products" TARGET="annotations">Other Products</A>.</B><BR>

    Initial Developer may include Covered Works in products other than
    the Initial Developer's Branded Code, without such additional
    products becoming subject to the terms of this License, and may
    license such additional products on different terms from those
    contained in this License.

    <P><B>5.3.  <A HREF="annotations-0.90.html#Alternative_Licensing" TARGET="annotations">Alternative Licensing</A>.</B><BR>

    Initial Developer may license the Source Code of Initial
    Developer's Branded Code, including Modifications incorporated
    therein, to third parties under different terms from those
    contained in this License.

</UL>
<P><B>6. Versions of the License.</B>
<UL>

    <P><B>6.1.  <A HREF="annotations-0.90.html#By_Initial_Developer" TARGET="annotations">By Initial Developer</A>.</B><BR>

    The Initial Developer may publish revised and/or new versions of
    the License from time to time, which shall be applicable to Covered
    Works made publicly available after the date of the new license.
    Such new versions will be similar in spirit to this License, but
    may differ to address problems or concerns.  Each version will be
    given a distinguishing version number.  No one other than Initial
    Developer has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered
    Works created under this License.

    <P><B>6.2.  <A HREF="annotations-0.90.html#For_New_Code" TARGET="annotations">For New Code</A>.</B><BR>

    If You wish to act as the Initial Developer for code which is not
    already a Covered Work (``New Code''), You may use this document
    and list Yourself as the Initial Developer and Your New Code as
    Original Code at the top of this document.  You may also modify
    this License and use a modified version of this License for Your
    New Code.  However, if You modify this License other than by
    changing the name of the Initial Developer and Original Code, You
    must rename Your license so that it is clear that Your version of
    the license has been modified (for example, ``Modified Netscape
    Public <NOBR>License --</NOBR> [Your Name]'' or ``[Your Name]
    Public License'').

    Each Covered Work is a ``commercial item,'' as that term is defined
    in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ``commercial computer
    software'' and ``commercial computer software documentation,'' as
    such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent
    with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4
    (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Works

    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
    matter hereof and may be amended only by a writing executed by both
    parties.  If any provision of this License is held to be
    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
    necessary to make it enforceable.  Unless otherwise agreed in

    dispute relating to intellectual property rights) shall be subject
    to final and binding arbitration in Santa Clara County, California,
    under the auspices of JAMS/EndDispute, with the losing party paying
    all costs of arbitration. This License shall be governed by
