      the Mozilla source code from MPL or NPL to the current MPL/GPL/LGPL
      tri-licence.

	    This document contains the Netscape Public License, in the
	    form of Amendments to the Mozilla Public License along
	    with the MPL itself.  It is also available in <a
	    href="NPL-1.1.txt">plain text</a>. Note that the NPL is no longer      
      used with Mozilla code, although it may still be used in other
      contexts.

 <dd>
     Since legal documents are difficult for non-lawyers to read,
     we've provided a version of the license which contains informal
     explanations of various sections of the license, in the form of
     hyperlinks.  Note that <em>these explanations are not the license.</em>
     The explanations are not a legal document, or legal advice.  
     If you need to know <em>exactly</em> what the license requires, you
     need to read and understand the license itself; if you need legal
     advice, you need to talk to a lawyer.  The annotations are merely
     a good faith effort to explain the license in simpler language.

     This is the license under which the Mozilla source code
     has been released, in all its legalese glory.
     It is also available in <a href="NPL-1.0.txt">plain text</a>.
     Note that version 1.0 of the NPL was replaced with NPL version
     1.1, and is now obsolete.
