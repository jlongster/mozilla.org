<h2><a name="intro">Where Are We Today?</a></h2>
  <p>The accessibility of computer software has seen drastic
improvements over the past two decades. This article reviews the
progress and technology as it has developed.</p>
  <p>Up until this point, the largest driving force behind desktop
computing environments has been Microsoft, first with MS DOS, followed
by variants of Microsoft Windows. These operating systems were not
designed with the needs of people with disabilities in mind. Many,
including those who were blind or physically disabled, were unable to
use applications which were written for Microsoft operating systems.
These applications assumed that computer users could:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Read and react to text and images displayed on the screen.</li>
    <li>Type on a standard keyboard.</li>
    <li>Select text, pictures, and other information using a mouse</li>
    <li>React to sounds played. This tends to be somewhat less of a
limitation in that most software doesn't rely exclusively on audio to
relay feedback.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If a person was unable to do one of the above-listed tasks, they
found themselves unable to use many popular computer applications. Here
are some of the groups of people that have problems doing some of those
tasks:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Print disabled: blind, deaf-blind, low vision, obstructed
vision, dyslexic, cognitively disabled and illiterate individuals.</li>
    <li>Physically disabled: users have amputations, paralysis,
repetitive stress, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, Parkinson's or
other problems limiting mobility.</li>
    <li>Hearing impaired</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We must also consider the increasing numbers of aging baby boomers
that are beginning to experience problems with their sight, vision or
dexterity. When you add all these groups of people together, that's a
lot of potential users!</p>
  <p>In answer to this problem, many small accessibility hardware and
software vendors created products and software which helped people who
could not perform one of the four basic tasks to use common computer
applications. Some examples of these assistive devices and software
include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Screen reading software, which speaks text displayed on the
screen using hardware or software text-to-speech, and which allows a
blind person to use the keyboard to simulate mouse actions</li>
    <li>Alternate input devices, which allow people with physical
disabilities to use alternatives to a keyboard and mouse</li>
    <li>Voice recognition software, which allows a person to simulate
typing on a keyboard or selecting with a mouse by speaking into the
computer</li>
    <li>Screen magnification software, which allows a low-vision
computer user to more easily read portions of the screen</li>
    <li>Comprehension software, which allows a dyslexic or learning
disabled computer user to see and hear text as it is manipulated on the
computer screen</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In fact, the entire adaptive technology industry has grown up
around these issues. One great place to go and learn about this
industry is the <a class="ex-ref" href="http://www.csun.edu/cod/">CSUN conference</a>
in Los Angeles, which takes place every year in mid-late March.</p>

<h2><a name="altoutput">Alternative ways to access the screen's contents</a></h2>
  <p>Most computer programs are so visual, they are difficult or
impossible to use for persons with visual impairments. This need not be
the case. Here's how non-print readers use desktop software today:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><dfn style="text-decoration: underline;">Text-to-speech (TTS)</dfn>
- makes the computer talk to the user: Those who can't read print at all
usually use talking programs (text-to-speech). Talking programs are also useful
for print disabilities other than visual impairments, such as dyslexia.
Additionally, text-to-speech is used by those who cannot speak, in
place of their own voice. Finally, this technology could be useful to
mainstream users, on portable information appliances, or to access
information when the eyes are busy elsewhere. </li>
    <li><i style="text-decoration: underline;">Magnification</i> -
enlarges the screen's contents: For those with low vision, it may suffice to
use a larger font, a built-in high contrast theme, or even just an an extra
large screen. Otherwise, screen magnification programs may be used, which
allow zooming in to portions of the screen, while following the mouse or the
current focus. Screen magnifiers also have some built-in text-to-speech
and the ability to filter text and images through various color
palettes, such as black on yellow for high contrast, or green on blue
for low contrast. </li>
    <li><i style="text-decoration: underline;">The Optacon</i> -
provides access to printed words, graphics and on-screen information by means
of an array vibrating pins the size of an index finger. The user uses one hand
to read the vibrating pins, and the other hand moves a mini-camera over the
material to be read. Unfortunately, the unit is not currently produced,
although there is occasional talk of resurrecting this useful device. </li>
    <li><i style="text-decoration: underline;">Braille</i> -
is a solution used for quiet reading, for detailed work, and by deaf-blind
users. This can come in the form of hard copy braille printed on braille embossers,
or from a refreshable braille display (see below). These technologies requires
special drivers, braille formatting routines and software based
text-to-braille translation. The importance of braille itself must be
emphasized. For those that read it, braille can offer higher levels of
employment and life fulfillment.</li>
  </ul>

  <table style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><img src="powerbraille.jpg" alt="A braille display" width="303"
height="189"></td>
        <td><i>Left: refreshable braille<br>
displays of various sizes.</i></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><i>Right: a braille embosser</i></td>
        <td><img src="vpduo2.jpg" alt="A braille embosser" width="184" height="171"></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>Audio- and braille- based user interfaces are concepts that
software designers are historically untrained for. The basic concept is
easy - dealing with information when you're blind is like seeing
everything through a mail slot - sequentially and methodically. Only
small pieces of sequential, non-graphical information can be conveyed -
via text-to-speech or a refreshable braille display. Whatever the user
does, the software needs to respond with small, bite sized pieces of
information that are as short and to the point as possible. Ideally,
intelligent decisions are made, so the user does not have to wade
through as much non-relevant data.</p>

<h2><a name="altinput">Alternative ways to command the computer and
enter data</a></h2>

  <p>Another problem is how people with disabilities get information
into the computer. If you're physically disabled, you may not be able
to type on a regular keyboard or use a mouse. Here are some of the
alternative ways physically disabled people enter information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><i style="text-decoration: underline;">Sticky keys</i>:
make entering key combinations easy. For example to make a capital letter,
first press the shift key, release it, then press the letter to be capitalized.
The sticky key technique is utilized by people who have only one usable hand,
or who have no use of their hands and type using a stick in their mouth. </li>
    <li><i style="text-decoration: underline;">Single switch</i>:
technologies enable persons with severe physical disabilities. Some, like
Stephen Hawking, enter information by choosing among lists of options. They
might press a switch down to begin moving a highlight bar through the list,
and release the switch when the desired option is highlighted.</li>
    <li><i style="text-decoration: underline;">Special keyboards</i>:
exist to make data entry easier. However, any special features are generally
handled in the keyboard itself, so that no special programming is required.</li>
    <li><i style="text-decoration: underline;">Speech recognition</i>:
technology lets people talk to the computer. This technology has come a long way,
but still needs to be more integrated into mainstream software.</li>
    <li><i style="text-decoration: underline;">Consistent keyboard support
and hotkeys</i>: Many people can't use a mouse. Extremely consistent
keystroke support is a very important consideration. Blind testers have knack
for finding ways to improve keystroke support in almost any given piece
of software. Testing with people that have disabilities generally benefits
everyone. Use the <a href="toolkit-checklist">accessible toolkit checklist</a>
to make sure your UI controls adhere to standards.</li>
  </ul>

<h2><a name="contextprob">A Major Limitation - the Lack of Context</a></h2>
  <p>The solutions developed by these accessibility vendors have
greatly increased the employment and personal fulfillment opportunities
of hundreds of thousands of persons with disabilities, and the
importance of their work cannot be diminished. However, all these
solutions fell short of providing people with disabilities with a
working environment which was completely accessible and usable by them.
This is due to a simple problem of context - the idea that a user's
interaction with a computer is governed by the situation in which this
interaction takes place. When the user types something on the keyboard,
or when an application displays text or images on the screen, the exact
meaning of these actions is determined by the context in which they
take place. For example, one application might display the image of a
light bulb to indicate that it is processing a task, while another
might display it as an indicator that it has completed processing a
task. Without the application somehow notifying a blind person about
the meaning of the light bulb image, the blind person is unable to
understand what the application is attempting to convey. Similarly,
voice recognition software often needs information about the context of
a user's interaction, in order to make sense of what the user is
speaking. This context problem still plagues modern accessibility aids
and solutions.</p>

<p>The most recent noteable attempt at
solving this problem was put forth by Microsoft in 1997, and is called
<dfn>Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA)</dfn>. Realizing that 
complete accessibility was not possible without cooperation between 
applications and accessibility aids such as screen reading software 
or voice recognition software, Microsoft Active
Accessibility defines a Windows-based standard by which applications
can communicate context and other pertanent information to
accessibility aids. This solution has seen only partial success,
largely due to the fact that it requires significant changes to applications
which are made accessible. Because most popular desktop and productivity
applications are not open source, this forced disabled people to rely
on the companies which produce this software to make it
accessible. These companies were often reluctant for various reasons
including the large amount of time required to do so. On a positive
note, recent federal purchasing rules such as Section 508 have caused
many companies to pay attention and implement MSAA support.</p>

<h2><a name="entermsaa">Enter Open Source Software</a></h2>
  <p>Microsoft was on the right track with Microsoft Active
Accessibility, but because the source code to most popular desktop
applications which are used in large corporations is not publicly
available, they were never made fully accessible. In open source,
however, making the necessary modifications to make them accessible is
very possible.</p>
  <p>Open source software is an ideal way to the needs of disabled
users, because accessibility can be fully integrated into the core
designs, rather than tacked onto as an afterthought. It also gives
disabled programmers a chance to control their own destiny, by giving
them the opportunity and the right to directly fix the innaccessible
software themselves.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, any software solution that can enable equality should
by all rights be free of charge - an integral part of society's
infrastructure. If no special hardware is required, why should a
disabled person pay extra money to use the same software as everyone
else? That said, there is still an important role for adaptive
technology vendors in creating special services and hardware, or even
proprietary software on platforms where that is appropriate. . The
ideal situation would be for adaptive technology professionals to make
money on rehab, trainingand support - something there is currently not
enough of. Each end user has a unique set problems, and in the open
source world, providing highly customized solutions can be a business
in itself.</p>
  <p>Right now, GUI's on Linux are mostly not accessible. Microsoft
Windows is still far more accesible. Gnome,
KDE, StarOffice, KOffice, Mozilla and all other GUI software packages
in Linux are unuseable by large numbers of disabled users. There
has been some progress with the support of Gnome's ATK APIs in many of
these packages, and the development of GOK (Gnome Onscreen Keyboard)
and Gnopernicus (screenreader and magnifier). However, these solutions
are not yet truly usable for real disabled end users.</p>

<h2><a name="solutions">What Do I Need to Do?</a></h2>

<h3>Mozilla developers</h3>
<ul>
  <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Follow the general
front-end accessibility requirements</span>:<br>
There are a number of potential "gotchas" when developing XUL UI.
Please follow the practical techniques put forth listed in the <a
 href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/Accessible_XUL_Authoring_Guidelines">Accessible XUL Authoring Guidelines</a>.
These guidelines cover many possible scenarios. If you
take a little time to learn them, they will become an unconscious
improvement to your design and engineering technique.<br><br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ensure correct
keyboard accessibility when developing new controls:</span><br>
Mozilla's XUL and HTML widgets already support proper keyboard
accessibility, so let's not regress in that area. Make sure that every
new UI control that's developed provides the correct keyboard support.<br>
Follow the <a href="toolkit-checklist">Accessible toolkit checklist</a>
whenever using XBL to create a new widget.<br><br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Support MSAA and
ATK via nsIAccessible when developing new controls</span>:<br>
Mozilla is a great position to provide context so that custom controls
can be made accessible. Engineers can provide context simply by
creating an nsIAccessible for each custom control. The infrastructure
to do this is straightforward.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other developers</h3>
<p>No matter what kind of work you do, the basis of accessibility is the need to understand that every user is different. After that, the exact techniques may change depending on the engineering environment. See <a href="#resources">Links and Resources</a> below for information and tools for both web and desktop application developers.
