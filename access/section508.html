The United States Federal Rehabilitation Act's Section 508 is a new
standard for defining accessibility requirements for
software and other electronic and information technology.
<a
 href="http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=Content&amp;ID=12#Software" class="ex-ref">Part
of Section 508 (&sect;1194.21) specifically relates to Mozilla</a>, and
the ability of US government agencies to buy software
that contains Mozilla software components.

keyboard, product functions shall be executable from a keyboard where
the function itself or the result of performing a function can be
discerned textually.</td>

Caveats: 1) Although sidebar
cannot be customized without a mouse, all sidebar functions that come
with the browser are available through other means 2) Java and in-page
plugins cannot be used with the keyboard, so they must not be installed
for keyboard-only users<br><br>

Additional features for the keyboard: 1) <a href="type-ahead/">Find
as you type</a> allows for quick navigation to links and convenient
text searching 2) Browse with caret (<kbd>F7</kbd> key toggles) allows users to
select arbitrary content with the keyboard and move through content as
if inside a readonly editor.</td>

keyboard bugs. Needs more investigation.</td>

features of other products that are identified as accessibility
features, where those features are developed and documented according

activated features of any operating system that are identified as
accessibility features where the application programming interface for
those accessibility features has been documented by the manufacturer of
the operating system and is available to the product developer.</td>

shall be provided that moves among interactive interface elements as
the input focus changes. The focus shall be programmatically exposed so
that assistive technology can track focus and focus changes.</td>
      <td colspan="2"><em>Complete</em>. We expose focus
programmatically via MSAA (Windows) and ATK (Linux/UNIX).</td>

programmatically by supporting Carbon/Cocoa accessibility.</td>

operating system's font and color contrast settings. When the Windows
"high contrast theme" is used Classic, and thus the system look and
feel, is automatically selected.</td>
      <td><em>Complete when run in the Gnome desktop</em>. The default
theme, Classic, uses Gnome's font and color contrast settings. Under
Linux/UNIX it is the user's choice, whether to stick with the Gnome
theme or not -- they must choose Classic if they want to follow the
Gnome theme. </td>

Privacy &amp; Security - Images contain options for making animated
images still.</td>

      <td>(i) Color coding shall not be used as the only means of
conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or
distinguishing a visual element.</td>

a color change to indicate when a link has been
visited. However, the visited link appearance can be altered via a user
style sheet.</td>

      <td>(j) When a product permits a user to adjust color and
contrast settings, a variety of color selections capable of producing a
range of contrast levels shall be provided.</td>

preferences panel contains a large number of color possibilities.</td>

objects, or other elements having a flash or blink frequency greater
than 2 Hz and lower than 55 Hz.</td>
      <td colspan="3"><em>Complete</em>. Mozilla supports of
&lt;blink&gt; and text-decoration: blink in web pages. In these
situations Mozilla blinks 1 Hz, which is within the allowable range and
follows the stricter MIL-STD standard.</td>

people using assistive technology to access the information, field
elements, and functionality required for completion and submission of
the form, including all directions and cues.</td>

performance criteria below. Screen reader access is currently being
tested. An extension called Ad Block helps remove extra noisy content
from web pages that clutter accessibility.</td>

version 8.11. Caveat, the document reading and
app readings modes don't support columnized text. The focus is not
always correctly echoed via text to speech. However, it is functional
and very possible to use ZoomText with Mozilla in this mode. Have
contacted AI Squared to work on reamining issues.</td>
