<p>Find As You Type (formerly called Type Ahead Find) is a feature that allows
quick web page navigation when you type a succession of characters in the body
of the displayed page (not in an edit box of or drop down list). The coding of
Find As You Type was contributed to Mozilla by Netscape Corporation.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Type several characters into the active browser window to navigate to any
link with that text in it</li>
  <li>If you repeat the same character, it will start to cycle through
all the links that begin with that character. However, if it can find a
match with the exact string you've typed, such as "oo" in "woods" it will
go there first. Typing "o" more times will then cycle through the links that
start with "o".</li>
  <li>Use the backspace key to undo the last character typed</li>
  <li>Type a ' before your string to search only links. Type / before
your string to search all text.</li>
  <li>You can use the text search field to get to buttons, text boxes and other
form controls. Just search for the text right before it, and then press Tab when
to move from there.</li>
  <li>To cancel a find, change focus or scroll, press Escape, or wait
for the timeout</li>
  <li>Press Accel+G or F3 to use "find next". Press Accel+Shift+G or
Shift+F3 to find previous, with the current string you've typed. This respects
the current "linksonly" setting. Note: 'accel' means Ctrl on Windows, and Cmd
on Mac. On Unix, 'accel' usually means Ctrl, but it can be set to Alt.</li>
  <li>Works with any Gecko HTML content window - embedded clients, IM
conversation window, help, etc.</li>
  <li>works with IME for input of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, etc.</li>
  <li>When focused on a link, the following keys will work:
  <ul>
     <li>Enter - activate the link</li>
     <li>Shift+Enter - save the page that the link points to</li>
     <li>Ctrl+Enter (Cmd+Enter on Mac) - open the link in a new window</li>
     <li>Insert - open the link in a new foreground or background tab, depending
on the "Load links in the background" pref. under Preferences - Navigator -
Tabbed Browsing.</li>
     <li>Shift+Insert - same as Insert, but does the opposite of the
foreground/background pref</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Deactivating it</h2>

<p>Find As You Type is currently part of the default install. To turn
it off, use:<br><br>
user_pref <kbd>("accessibility.typeaheadfind", false);</kbd></p>

<p>Or, to remove it completely, find all files in your installation subdirectories
that match *typeaheadfind*, and delete those files.</p>

<h2>Reactivating it</h2>

<p>To turn it back on, use:<br><br>
user_pref <kbd>("accessibility.typeaheadfind", true);</kbd></p>

<h2>Settings</h2>
<p>There is a new Keyboard Navigation preferences panel, under Preferences -
Advanced. It contains a few Find As You Type Preferences, such as startup options,
and whether the timeout or sound should be enabled.</p>

<p>If you want to fine tune your settings by hand, Find As You Type uses the following prefs as defaults, which
can be changed in your prefs.js file:</p>

<p><kbd>user_pref("accessibility.typeaheadfind.autostart", true); // If true, just typing can automatically start Find As You Type. If false, you must hit / (find text) or ' (find links) before your search</kbd>
<br><br>
    <kbd>user_pref("accessibility.typeaheadfind.linksonly", true);
   // If true, defaults to linksonly as user starts typing. User can override
it by pressing / for all text, or ' for links only<br>
     </kbd> <kbd><br>
user_pref("accessibility.typeaheadfind.startlinksonly", false);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
// If true, matches only to the start of links when searching only for links</kbd><br>
     <br>
     <kbd>user_pref("accessibility.typeaheadfind.timeout", 3000); // if
&gt; 0, # of milliseconds since user last typed, before the find is cancelled.</kbd><br>
     <br>
     <kbd>user_pref("ui.textSelectBackgroundAttention", "#rrggbb"); // where
rrggbb is the hex color you want for found text.</kbd>    <br><br>
     <kbd>user_pref("accessibility.typeaheadfind.enablesound", false); // error sound on? (it is currently off by default for Linux/Unix, on by default for other platforms)</kbd>
<br><br>
<kbd>user_pref("accessibility.typeaheadfind.soundURL", "filename"); // Specify your own wav file for the error sound, or use the string "default" for the default sound or "beep" for the system beep</kbd>
</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>The source is checked into <a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/extensions/typeaheadfind/">mozilla/extensions/typeaheadfind</a></p>
<p>Basically when it gets initialized as a component, it starts listening
for domwindowopened events via nsIWindowWatcher, and attaches a keypress
listeners to these windows. Whenever a keypress occurs in a new window, it
checks to see if Find As You Type should auto-activate in that window (that
is, if it's not an editor or mailnews window, etc.).</p>
<p>If autostart is disabled (when / or ' are required to start typeaheadfind),
it receives the command through the nsICommand interface. The commands are
specified in htmlBindings.xml</p>
<p>After that, it simply keeps track of the characters typed and uses
the low level nsIFind interface to see if it can find that text. It actually
does this twice for a page, so that it can prefer text that's visible on
the page.</p>

<h2>TypeAheadFind for Embeddors</h2>
<p>TypeAheadFind is now an option for embeddors (as of September 28,
2002).</p>
<ol>
  <li>Find the file called <kbd>mozilla/embedding/config/basebrowser-[yourplatformname]</kbd>
and uncomment the 2 lines that list files (a binary file and an <kbd>.xpt</kbd>
file).</li>
  <li>cd <kbd>mozilla/embedding/config</kbd></li>
  <li><kbd>make</kbd></li>
</ol>
<p>You should now have typeaheadfind enabled in your <kbd>dist/Embed</kbd>
directory.</p>

<h2>To Be Done</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Have it be able to search button text, as well as alt/title text
on tooltips for images and objects -- the tooltip would popup with found
text highlighted. This is <a
 href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=158757" title="Status: NEW; Target: Future">bug 158757: Make type ahead find work with button and image labels</a>.</li>
  <li>Change dotted focus outline to something more visible. See <a
 href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=53927" title="Status: NEW; Target: Future">bug 53927: Focus outlines (ring) should look like Mac focus outlines on Mac OS</a> and <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=151375" title="Status: RESOLVED FIXED" style="text-decoration: line-through;">bug 151375: focus outline should be drawn outside of element</a>.</li>
</ul>
