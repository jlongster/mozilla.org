<blockquote>&ldquo;...Firefox is a great little browser. It's a quick download, occupies
very little disk space, and has a clean, no-nonsense interface.&rdquo; - PC Magazine</blockquote>

<p>Firefox 1.5 is a fast, free, standards compliant web browser which
is rapidly gaining recognition for its fresh, streamlined approach to browsing the web. In addition to winning  major awards such
as PC World Product of the Year, Firefox has attracted a huge
following among savvy users who simply care enough about their web
browsing experience to download a new piece of software.
Websites such as online magazines
  with sophisticated audiences are now reporting upwards of 25% Firefox usage. </p>

<p>Why do the most discerning users switch to Firefox? Because Firefox
rethinks the web, and does away with many of the common
annoyances that cause browsing to be difficult for
ordinary people. Firefox's "WWW for everyone" philosophy is also a
great accessibility story. Every user, regardless of what accomodations they need,
  can enjoy a less cluttered web, free of intrusions such as popup ads and spyware. The
simple, uncluttered user interface is simply more pleasant. As a result, nearly
  everyone who
tries Firefox finds themselves hooked..

<h1>Assistive Technology Support on Windows</h1>

<blockquote>"I am a full Firefox convert with the release of 1.5. At my next opportunity, 
I intend to convert my family over to it too.
" -- Darren Paskell, from Window-Eyes beta testing list</blockquote>



<p>Firefox works with popular screen
readers, with the best support currently coming from GW Micro's
Window-Eyes 5.5. JAWS support is quickly catching up as well. In recent articles from both AFB's Access World and NFB's Voice of the Nation's Blind,
  reviewers found no significant
roadblocks in moving to
Firefox from Internet Explorer for screen reader users. In fact, the
same keyboard commands are still available, so users can
become comfortable and productive right away.
</p>


<p>Screen magnifier users can also benefit from Firefox's powerful
features today, as caret and focus tracking are fully enabled. Mozilla
Corporation is currently reaching out to work with AI Squared, the
makers of ZoomText, in order to enable complete support of
advanced ZoomText features such as the Doc Reader and App Reader.</p>

<p>

Firefox on Linux currently boasts the best onscreen keyboard support
in the industry via GOK, the Gnome Onscreen Keyboard. Basic screen reader
accessibility is available via Gnopernicus or the Fire Vox extension.</p>

<h1>Keyboard Support</h1>

<blockquote>"Mozilla Firefox is a web-browser with superior keyboard support.
" - Alan Cantor, Cantor Access Consulting (http://www.cantoraccess.com)</blockquote>

<p>

Firefox includes keyboard access to all of its amazing features:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Find as you type allows for quick navigation to links and text
searching without opening a separate dialog -- this allows more
convenient use by screen magnification users because there is a single
point of regard for the search. It also assists users of input aids
because there are far fewer keys to type to get the desired location.
For example, it is possible to navigate to the desired link by pressing
2 letter keys rather than tabbing through many links to get there. </li>

  <li>Browse with caret allows users to select arbitrary content with the
keyboard and move through content as if inside a read-only editor. This
allows copying arbitrary pieces of text to the clipboard. The F7 key
toggles this feature on/off.</li>

  <li>Tabbed browsing helps keyboard users by putting all of the browsed
documents in one Firefox application window rather than cluttering the
Alt+Tab order which makes keyboard navigation within the entire Windows
OS much simpler.</li>

  <li>Both history and bookmarks can be searched with a "quick search"
field that quickly narrows the list down via a substring search.</li>
  <li>Bookmarks can have a keyword assigned to them which can be typed
into the address bar to bring up the bookmark. A "smart keywords"
feature enhances this even further by allowing custom searches from the
command line such as "word punditry" to look up the word "punditry" in an online
dictionary. These smart keywords can be setup via the context menu for
the search field on the desired website. </li>

  <li>Integrated web search via Ctrl+K is much faster to use than first
going to the search tool's web site. Custom searches can be added to
this quick search bar and the user can switch between them by choosing
from a drop down available via the standard Alt+down arrow key
combination.</li>

  <li>The built-in text zoom feature can be accessed with the Ctrl+plus
and Ctrl+minus hotkeys.</li>

  <li>The Accessibility Extension may be installed on top of Firefox,
allowing keyboard access to document structure.</li>

  <li>Caret browsing allows you to move through web content one letter
a time. You can even select web content and copy it to the clipboard.
-- all with the keyboard  </li>

  <li>Moving back and forward by web page (Alt+Left and Alt+Right) occurs near-instantaneously</li>

  <li>The download manager provides keyboard access to all of your recent downloads</li>

</ul>

<h1>Customize Your Experience!</h1>

<p>Many users are finding the true greatness of Firefox lies in support
for third party extensions. Extensions are small add-ons
which can change your browser experience as you see fit. Extensions can
easily be installed or removed with the extension manager in the Tools
menu.</p>

<p>
Here are some examples of accessible extensions, although there are hundreds more
  to try (thank you to the GW Micro knowledge base for some of this information):
</p>

<ul>

  <li>Adblock Plus removes ads (and other objects, like banners) from web pages</li>

  <li>Greasemonkey lets you add
bits of Javascript ("user scripts") to any web page to change its
behavior.
In much the same way that user CSS lets you take control of a web
page's style, user scripts let you easily control any aspect of a web
page's design or interaction. We expect enterprising script writers
will eventually fix annoying accessibility issues in popular web pages,
and (hopefully) share their tricks with everyone!</li>

  <li>IE Tab allows you to embed Internet Explorer into Firefox
tabs. This extension is useful for making IE specific sites, or site
that read better in IE, open directly in Firefox, while using the
Internet Explorer engine</li>

  <li>Tab Mix Plus completely enhances Firefox's tab browsing
capabilities. It includes such features as duplicating tabs,
controlling tab focus, tab clicking options, undo closed tabs and
windows, plus much more. It also includes a full-featured session
manager with crash recovery that can save and restore combinations of
opened tabs and windows.</li>

  <li>Fire Vox is a screen reader extension built just for Firefox which can read MathML</li>

  <li>The Accessibility Extension, from the University of Illinois,
provides new menus and keyboard shortcuts for accessing every feature
of a web page</li>

</ul>

<h1>
  Community Contributions</h1>

<p>The real reason behind Firefox's success is the great community of
volunteers and organizations that realize they have something to
benefit from a browser open to utilizing their ideas and hard work. 
Contributions come in many forms. The Mozilla Firefox
community welcomes bug reports, ideas, documentation, answering
questions in the support forums --  and nearly any kind of
community involvement resulting
  in a browser built for a broader audience of users and developers.</p>
  <p>
    Here are a couple of success stories from businesses who contributed accessibility
    code because they needed an accessible web browser which supported their software:</p>

  <h2>
    IBM Contributes Accessible Web Applications (DHTML and AJAX)</h2>
<p>

IBM realized it needed a way to enable accessibility for ever more powerful
web applications, beyond what you see on typical web pages today. Rather than
go and write their own new web browser, IBM decided to trust in the
openness of the Mozilla community, which accepted IBM's significant
contributions. For example, IBM has delivered over 50,000 lines of code
to enable accessibility in Firefox on Windows and especially for this
new powerful world of "web applications". A web application may be an
easier-to-use online tax assistant, a web calendar or a live sports
statistics page, which is familiar in that it acts much like a desktop
application. Whether the current buzzword for this technology is "DHTML", "AJAX" or "Web 2.0" doesn't really matter. This fact remains: the web is
changing to become more interactive and less like a bunch of plain
documents. Firefox is currently the only browser to support the new
evolving standards for making these web applications accessible.
Companies such as Yahoo! have announced they are already working with the technology their new
richer interfaces accessible with this new technology.</p>

<h2>
  Sun Contributes Code to Improve Accessibility on UNIX</h2>
  <p>
    A similar story occurred at Sun Microsystems. Sun needed an
accessible web browser for UNIX, specifically for Solaris. Again, rather than develop a brand new
web browser, it made more sense to contribute fixes that make Firefox accessible on UNIX. Thanks to Sun's
efforts we already have excellent support for the GOK onscreen keyboard.
Meanwhile, IBM has joined Sun's effort to make Firefox as screen reader
accessible on UNIX as it is on Windows, because the same core accessibility work applies to Linux. The two companies anticipate that
in 2007, Firefox will support topnotch screen reader accessibility on
UNIX and Linux.</p>

<p>That's the great thing about the open Firefox community model and
source code license
  -- anyone can contribute, and everyone benefits.</p>
