We've made a lot of progress with
Mozilla/ZoomText compatibility.
<br>
Here's how you can test:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Download a copy of <a
 href="http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mozilla/releases/mozilla1.8a6/mozilla-win32-1.8a6-installer.exe">Mozilla
1.8a6</a> (this is not Firefox). Read the <a
 href="http://www.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla1.8a6/">release notes</a>
if you're interested. These
builds are pretty
stable considering they're only alpha, I'm having very good luck
with them. It doesn't do us any good to get bug reports on older stuff
right now. Our main focus is on the browser itself,
so you you only need to install mailnews or address book if
curious about the other apps.<br>
  </li>
  <li>You will also need to install ZoomText 8.11.3.</li>
  <li>Happy testing! You may wish to read through the current issues on
this
page before reporting bugs. Send me
email so that I'm aware that you're testing and let me know what bugs
you're finding. My email address is <a
 href="mailto:aaronleventhal@moonset.net">aaronleventhal@moonset.net</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h1><a name="zoomtext_issues"></a>Issues for AI Squared, from high to low
priority</h1>
<ol>
  <li>DocReader and AppReader don't respect the structure of the document -- no support for columns.
  </li>
  <li>ZoomText text to speech doesn't always echo what it should -- need more details from testers.</li>
  </ol>

<h1><a name="moz_issues"></a>Mozilla issues</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Cannot tab into frames and iframes.</li>
  <li>Cannot customize the sidebar with the keyboard only</li>
  <li>Comboboxes report incorrect bounds, causing ZoomText tracking to move to the wrong area of the screen.
</ol>
