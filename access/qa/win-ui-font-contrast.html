  <h1>Accessibility QA Test Case: Inherit system high contrast settings
  testcase</h1>

  <p>Firefox user interface on Microsoft Windows: Inherit Windows system
  font, color, and high contrast settings.</p>

  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>This test case describes the approach and methods used to test for
  inheritance of system high contrast settings, font size, and color schemes in
  the Firefox User Interface on the Windows operating system.</p>

  <p>At minimum, two high contrast color schemes must be tested: one with light
  colored text on a dark background, and one with dark colored text on a light
  background. The Windows system contrast settings must be inherited by the
  Firefox application. The two contrast schemes to be tested are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>High Contrast #1 (Extra Large): yellow text on a black background</li>

    <li>High Contrast White (Large): black text on a white background</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Large fonts will be tested as part of the above high contrast schemes.
  When large fonts are set, all text in the Firefox user interface should
  increase to the selected size. When displayed at the larger font size, all
  text must still be visible in the window, or a method of scrolling the text
  must be available to allow the user to view all of the text.</p>

  <p>This test case is based on IBM Software Accessibility Checklist version
  3.5.1, <a class="ex-ref" href=
  "http://www.ibm.com/able/guidelines/software/swhighcontrast.html">checkpoint
  4.3</a> and <a class="ex-ref" href=
  "http://www.ibm.com/able/guidelines/software/swsystemset.html">checkpoint
  4.5</a>.</p>

  <h2>Scope of test</h2>

  <p>Every menu pulldown option and dialog in the application, the install
  process, and the uninstall process should be tested to ensure that the system
  high contrast settings are inherited. The test must be done at twice: once
  with the light on dark color scheme, and once with the dark on light color
  scheme. (Additional color schemes may be tested also, if desired.)</p>

  <p>The specific menus and dialogs are not listed in this test case, but the
  techniques described here should be used for all menu pulldowns and dialogs,
  as appropriate.</p>

  <p>Note: The system settings documented in this test case are specifically
  for the Microsoft Windows operating system. The concepts described in this
  test case can be used when testing Firefox on another operating system, such
  as Linux, but the available system settings may be different.</p>

  <h2>Test Environment:</h2>

  <p>Operating system: Microsoft Windows (any version)</p>

  <h2>Tools required</h2>

  <p>No software tools are required for this test.</p>

  <p>Note that this is a visual test. There should be no assistive technologies
  (such as screen readers or screen magnifiers) running during the execution of
  this test case.</p>

  <h3>Test Case Instructions:</h3>

  <p>In this test, you must go through all menus and dialogs twice: once with a
  light on dark contrast scheme, and then again with a dark on light
  scheme.</p>

  <p>Note: It is important to remember that this test must be run with the
  Firefox install process (including the license agreement), the Firefox
  application itself, and also uninstall process.</p>

  <h4><a name="setup-info" id="setup-info">Setup hints</a></h4>

  <p>Various system high contrast options will need to be configured for this
  test case.</p>

  <p>Here is one way to set the high contrast mode in Windows, using the
  Windows Accessibility Options dialog. The testing sections that follow will
  instruct you to set specific high contrast modes for each step of this test
  case.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>To open the Windows Accessibility Options dialog:

      <ul>
        <li>Open the Windows <span>Start</span> menu</li>

        <li>select <span>Control Panel</span></li>

        <li>then select <span>Accessibility Options</span>.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Select the <span>Display notebook</span> tab.</li>

    <li>Set high contrast mode by checking the <strong>Use High
    Contrast</strong> checkbox.</li>

    <li>To select a specific high contrast mode:

      <ol class="c1">
        <li>select the <strong>Settings</strong> button (to the right of the
        "Use High Contrast" checkbox)</li>

        <li>in the <strong>High contrast appearance scheme</strong>, select the
        desired high contrast mode from the drop-down box</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h4><a name="hc-1" id="hc-1">Testing with High Contrast #1 (Extra Large):
  yellow text on black background</a></h4>

  <p>High Contrast #1 is a commonly used contrast scheme, using light colored
  text (yellow) on a dark (black) background. If an application has hard-coded
  a dark text color or a light colored background in a display panel, and does
  not properly inherit both the text and background color from the system, then
  the text may be invisible on the black background.</p>

  <p>Follow these instructions to test with the High Contrast #1 setting.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <span>Setup</span>: Select <strong>High Contrast #1 (Extra
      Large)</strong> scheme in the <em>Settings for High Contrast</em> dialog.

      <ul class="c2">
        <li>See setup hints section, above, for instructions on selecting high
        contrast settings.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <span>Install process</span>: Navigate through <em>all</em> menus and
      dialogs in the Firefox install process. For every menu item and dialog:

      <ul class="c2">
        <li>Verify all menu/dialog text is displayed with the selected yellow
        on black contrast scheme.</li>

        <li>Verify that all text is visible with the large font.

          <ul class="c3">
            <li>If the text no longer fits within the dialog window, there must
            be a method of viewing all of the text. For example, scroll bars
            will allow you to view all of the text. Make sure text does not
            "fall over" the edge of the window.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <span>Firefox Application</span>: Navigate through <em>all</em> menus and
      dialogs in the Firefox application. For every menu item and dialog:

      <ul class="c2">
        <li>Verify all menu/dialog text is displayed with the selected yellow
        on black contrast scheme.</li>

        <li>Verify that all text is visible with the large font. (As above,
        there must be a method of viewing all of the text.)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <span>Uninstall process</span>: Navigate through <em>all</em> menus and
      dialogs in the Firefox uninstall process (using Add/Remove Programs, in
      the Windows control panel). For every menu item and dialog:

      <ul class="c2">
        <li>Verify all menu/dialog text is displayed with the selected yellow
        on black contrast scheme.</li>

        <li>Verify that all text is visible with the large font. (As above,
        there must be a method of viewing all of the text.)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h4>Testing with High Contrast White (Large): black text on white
  background</h4>

  <p>The High Contrast White color scheme provides a dark colored text (black)
  on a light colored background (white). If an application has hard-coded a
  dark colored background or light colored text in a display panel, and does
  not properly inherit both the text and background colors from the system, the
  text may be invisible with this contrast scheme.</p>

  <p>Follow these instructions to test with the High Contrast White
  setting.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <span>Setup</span>: Select <strong>High Contrast White (Large)</strong>
      scheme in the <em>Settings for High Contrast</em> dialog.

      <ul class="c2">
        <li>See setup hints section, above, for instructions on selecting high
        contrast settings.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <span>Install process</span>: Navigate through <em>all</em> menus and
      dialogs in the Firefox install process. For every menu item and dialog:

      <ul class="c2">
        <li>Verify all menu/dialog text is displayed with the selected yellow
        on black contrast scheme.</li>

        <li>Verify that all text is visible with the large font.

          <ul class="c3">
            <li>If the text no longer fits within the dialog window, there must
            be a method of viewing all of the text. For example, scroll bars
            will allow you to view all of the text. Make sure text does not
            "fall over" the edge of the window.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <span>Firefox Application</span>: Navigate through <em>all</em> menus and
      dialogs in the Firefox application. For every menu item and dialog:

      <ul class="c2">
        <li>Verify all menu/dialog text is displayed with the selected yellow
        on black contrast scheme.</li>

        <li>Verify that all text is visible with the large font. (As above,
        there must be a method of viewing all of the text.)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <span>Uninstall process</span>: Navigate through <em>all</em> menus and
      dialogs in the Firefox uninstall process (using Add/Remove Programs, in
      the Windows control panel). For every menu item and dialog:

      <ul class="c2">
        <li>Verify all menu/dialog text is displayed with the selected yellow
        on black contrast scheme.</li>

        <li>Verify that all text is visible with the large font. (As above,
        there must be a method of viewing all of the text.)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
