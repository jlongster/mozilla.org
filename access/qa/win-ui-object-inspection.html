  <h1>Accessibility QA Test Case: Object inspection Testing</h1>

  <p>Firefox user interface on Microsoft Windows: Examine MSAA properties
  for all user interface elements.</p>

  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>This test case describes the approach and methods used to test the
  <dfn>Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA)</dfn> properties
  for user interface elements.</p>

  <p><abbr title="Microsoft Active Accessibility">MSAA</abbr> provides
  programming interfaces that allow an application to share
  information about user interface elements with assistive technology
  applications, such as screen readers.</p>

  <p>User interface elements include controls, objects, icons, images, and
  text. In other words, any part of the user interface with which the user
  interacts, either with the mouse, or with the keyboard. Any information
  provided in the user interface should also be available via a program
  interface, in this case, the
  <abbr title="Microsoft Active Accessibility">MSAA</abbr> interface. This
  allows an assistive technology, such as a screen reader, to provide
  the needed information to users who cannot see the screen.</p>

  <p>Here are examples of the types of information that must be provided for
  every user interface element in an application:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>What type of control currently has keyboard focus? (Is it a push
    button, check box, text input field?)</li>

    <li>What function will the control provide to the user? (Is it a password
    entry field? Is it a button to let me print the page?)</li>

    <li>Is there a label or text associated with the control, explaining the
    function?</li>

    <li>Is there a value or state associated with the control? (Did I already
    type something into a text entry field, or was a default value inserted for
    me already? Is the check box checked or unchecked?)</li>

    <li>Is there a keyboard shortcut associated with the control?</li>

    <li>Is there anything else I need to know about it that is not
    obvious?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This test case describes which MSAA properties should be analyzed to
  verify the above information is available.</p>

  <p>This test case is based on IBM Software Accessibility Checklist version
  3.5.1, <a class="ex-ref" href=
  "http://www.ibm.com/able/guidelines/software/swuiobject.html">checkpoint
  2.2</a>, <a class="ex-ref" href=
  "http://www.ibm.com/able/guidelines/software/swlabels.html">checkpoint
  2.3</a>, <a class="ex-ref" href=
  "http://www.ibm.com/able/guidelines/software/swforms.html">checkpoint
  2.4</a>, and <a class="ex-ref" href=
  "http://www.ibm.com/able/guidelines/software/swtextstandardsys.html">checkpoint
  4.1</a>.</p>

  <h2>Scope of test</h2>

  <p>The goal is to test every user interface element (text, graphics, and
  control elements) in every menu pulldown option and dialog. All dialogs in
  the Firefox install program, the Firefox application (browser), and the
  Firefox uninstall program should all be tested.</p>

  <p class="note">Note: The tools and accessibility properties discussed in
  this test case are specifically for the Microsoft Windows operating system
  and the MSAA interface.</p>

  <h2>Tools required</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Microsoft Inspect Objects: inspect32.exe

      <ul>
        <li>Inspect Objects is part of the Microsoft Active Accessibility SDK,
        and can be downloaded from the <a class="ex-ref" href=
        "http://www.microsoft.com/Downloads/">Microsoft Download Center</a> web
        site.</li>

        <li>Visit the Microsoft MSDN web site for <a class="ex-ref" href=
        "http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/msaa/msaastart_9w2t.asp">
        technical information about Microsoft Active Accessibility</a>.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Test Case Instructions:</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Start Inspect Objects (inspect32.exe) and Firefox.

      <ul>
        <li>It is best to start the object inspection tool (inspect32) before
        starting Firefox. This allows you to see where the default keyboard
        focus is placed when the application starts.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Use the keyboard to navigate through all menu options and dialogs
    provided by the software user interface. (See the appendix at the end of
    this file for <a href="#app-kbnav">keyboard navigation techniques</a>.)
    Move keyboard focus to each user interface element in every menu and
    dialog.

      <ul>
        <li>User interface elements are any controls, objects, icons, images
        provided in the user interface. Examples are push buttons, check boxes,
        radio buttons, lists and list items, combo boxes, text entry fields,
        spin boxes... In other words, any user interface element that a user is
        expected to interact with, either with the mouse, or with the
        keyboard.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>For each user interface element, verify that all information that is
    provided visually is also provided through the available MSAA properties.
    There are many properties defined in MSAA, but only a few are analyzed for
    this test. Observe the following MSAA properties displayed in the Inspect
    Objects output window. Use your judgment to decide if the necessary
    information is provided for each user interface element.

      <ul id="ListOfProperties">
        <li><strong>NAME</strong> - Every element <strong>must</strong> have a
        non-null Name property. Then name is usually the same as the text that
        is visually associated with the user element, and should reflect the
        meaning of the element, from the user's perspective. For example, the
        name should be the same as the label associated with a text input
        field, radio button, or check box. It should be the same as the button
        text, for push buttons. If you have an item highlighted in a menu
        pulldown, the name should be the same as the highlighted text.</li>

        <li><strong>ROLE</strong> - Every element <strong>must</strong> have a
        non-null Role property. The role should reflect the user's perspective
        of the type of element that has focus. For a push button, the role
        should be "Push Button". For a radio button, the role should be "Radio
        Button". A list item should have a role of "list item", and so on.
        Custom controls should have a role that reflects the function of the
        control; if it works like a combo box, the role should be "combo box",
        no matter how the custom control is implemented.</li>

        <li><strong>STATE</strong> - The State property should reflect the
        current state of the element, if appropriate. For example, a check box
        or radio button might have a state of either "checked" or "unchecked".
        In this case, both states should be tested with Inspect Objects, to
        verify each state is properly reflected through the MSAA interface. Use
        your judgment to decide if each element has associated states that
        should be provided to MSAA.</li>

        <li><strong>VALUE</strong> - The Value property is not required for
        every user interface element. For example, for text input fields, the
        Value property should contain the text that has been typed into the
        field. If the text input field is empty, the Value property would also
        be empty. Another example of the use of the Value property is a
        graphical link on a web page. If a graphic image has an associated
        hyperlink, the Value property is set to the URL of the target web page.
        Use your judgment to decide if each element should have an associated
        Value property.</li>

        <li><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong> - The Description property is not
        required, but is used to provide additional information about a user
        interface element when the other MSAA properties do not fully explain
        the function of the element. If a Description property is provided, use
        your judgment to decide if it is appropriate.</li>

        <li><strong>KbSHORTCUT</strong> - If an element has an associated
        keyboard shortcut, it should be provided in the KbShortcut property.
        For example, a password entry field might have a label "<span class=
        "accesskey">P</span>assword", where the letter "P" is underlined indicating
        that the keyboard shortcut of "Alt+P" can be used to move the keyboard
        focus to that password field. In this case, the KbShortcut property
        should contain "Alt+P" to reflect the available keyboard shortcut.</li>

        <li><strong>PARENT, ANCESTORS</strong> - In some cases, an element may
        be part of a larger grouping, or have a group of elements associated
        with it. For example, a radio button group may have several buttons,
        only one of which can be selected at any time. The entire grouping may
        have a label describing the function of the group. In this case, the
        Parent and/or the Ancestors properties should provide information about
        the higher level container associated with the group. Use your judgment
        to decide whether appropriate information is provided.</li>

        <li><strong>CHILDREN, CHILDCOUNT</strong> - Some elements, like a tree
        view, may have many children branching from the main element. In this
        case, the Children and Childcount properties may contain useful
        information. Use your judgment in these cases to decide whether
        appropriate information is provided.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3><a name="app-kbnav" id="app-kbnav">APPENDIX - KEYBOARD NAVIGATION
  TECHNIQUES</a></h3>

  <p>The following techniques can be used to navigate a Windows application
  using just the keyboard (without using the mouse).</p>

  <ol>
    <li>System menu (<kbd>Alt + Spacebar</kbd>)

      <ol>
        <li>Press <kbd>Alt + Spacebar</kbd> to access system menu</li>

        <li>Use <kbd>Arrow Keys</kbd> to move from option to option.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>Menu bar options (<kbd>Alt</kbd>)

      <ol>
        <li>Press <kbd>Alt</kbd> to access menu bar.</li>

        <li>Use <kbd>Arrow Key</kbd>s to move from option to option.</li>

        <li>Submenus can be opened and closed using <kbd>Right</kbd> and
        <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd> keys.</li>

        <li>The <kbd>Esc</kbd> key closes submenus and eventually returns
        focus to original focus location, before <kbd>Alt</kbd> was originally
        pressed.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>Toolbars (a row of icons across the top of the window, below the menu
    bar options)

      <ol>
        <li>The Toolbar elements should be part of the <kbd>Tab</kbd> ring. The
        <kbd>Arrow keys</kbd> might be used to move between icons on the
        toolbar.

          <ul>
            <li>Note: Some applications choose not to make the toolbar
            accessible from the keyboard. If the toolbar icons are not
            accessible through the keyboard, it <strong>must</strong> be
            possible to access an equivalent function using the keyboard for
            <strong>every</strong> option that can be added to the
            toolbar.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>Dialog navigation

      <ol>
        <li>The initial keyboard focus, when dialog is first opened, should be
        in a logical place (probably upper left-most element in the
        dialog).</li>

        <li>The <kbd>Tab</kbd> key can be used to move from option to
        option, and <strong>Shift+Tab</strong> moves in reverse order.</li>

        <li>Use the <kbd>Arrow keys</kbd> to move between elements in a group
        (such as a group of radio buttons).

          <ul>
            <li>Note that static text in a dialog is most often not included in
            the tab ring. All elements that require interaction with the user
            MUST be accessible with the keyboard.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>Application Window navigation (sections, panes, frames, notebook tabs,
    etc. that are part of the application window.)

      <ol>
        <li>Common keystrokes to navigate between parts of an application
        window:

          <ul>
            <li>Use <kbd>F6</kbd> to move between sections, panes and
            frames,</li>

            <li>Use <kbd>Ctrl+Tab</kbd> to change from one notebook tab
            to another, as in multiple web pages open in multiple notebook tabs
            in the Firefox window.)</li>

            <li>Review the Windows keyboard shortcuts for common keystrokes
            used with Windows applications. In Windows XP, you can find more
            information about Windows keyboard shortcuts by searching the Help
            and Support Center for "windows keyboard shortcuts overview".</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>Context menus (box of options displayed when user clicks right mouse
    button on a user interface element, such as an icon.)

      <ol>
        <li>Use <kbd>Shift+F10</kbd> to open context menus for element
        that has current keyboard focus.</li>

        <li>Use <kbd>Arrow keys</kbd> to move between items in context
        menu.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>User Interface Elements and Controls (common elements are listed here,
    with keystrokes used to use them)

      <ol>
        <li>Push Buttons: selectable with either the <kbd>Enter</kbd> or
        <kbd>Spacebar</kbd> key.</li>

        <li>Check boxes: <kbd>Spacebar</kbd> will select/deselect a check
        box.</li>

        <li>Radio button groups: <kbd>Tab</kbd> moves from one radio
        button group to the next element, and <kbd>Arrow keys</kbd> move
        from one radio button to another within a group.</li>

        <li>Text input fields: <kbd>Tab</kbd> moves to and from the input
        field. (Note, however, that if tabs are allowed within the field,
        another method of exiting the field must be provided!)</li>

        <li>Spin boxes: <kbd>Up</kbd> and <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd>
        keys can increase or decrease the value of the spin box.</li>

        <li>Tree views: Branches of tree views can be opened with <kbd>Right
        Arrow</kbd>, and closed with <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd> keys.</li>

        <li>Drop down boxes: Opened with <kbd>Alt+Down Arrow</kbd>.</li>

        <li>Any other user interface elements should be usable with standard
        and intuitive keystrokes.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>
