  <h1>Accessibility QA Test Case: Windows UI keyboard navigation and focus</h1>

  <p>Firefox user interface on Microsoft Windows: keyboard
  navigation and visual focus on Windows</p>

  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>This test case describes the approach and methods used to test keyboard
  navigation and visual focus of the Firefox user interface (chrome) on the
  Windows operating system. It must be possible to access all program functions
  using the keyboard, with no mouse required. As the keyboard is used to
  navigate the application, there must be a clear visual indicator as to which
  part of the application currently has focus.</p>

  <p>Note that navigation of the user content area of Firefox, i.e., the area
  where a Web page is actually displayed, is not tested in this test case. Only
  the application's user interface (menus and dialogs) are tested here.</p>

  </ol>

  <p>This test case is based on IBM Software Accessibility Checklist version
  3.5.1, <a href=
  "http://www.ibm.com/able/guidelines/software/swkbdequiv.html">checkpoint
  1.1</a> and <a href=
  "http://www.ibm.com/able/guidelines/software/swvisualfocus.html">checkpoint
  2.1</a>.</p>

  <h2>Scope of test</h2>

  <p>Every dialog and menu pulldown option in the application, the install, and
  the uninstall process must be tested to ensure all functions that can be
  accessed with a mouse can also be accessed or accomplished using only the
  keyboard. Each menu option and dialog is not listed here, but the techniques
  described here should be used for all menu pulldowns and dialogs, as
  appropriate.</p>

  <p>Note: The keystrokes documented in this test case are specifically for the
  Microsoft Windows operating system. The concepts described in this test case
  can be used when testing Firefox on another operating system, such as LinuxÂ®,
  but the keystrokes may be different.</p>

  <h2>Test Environment</h2>

  <p>Operating system: Microsoft Windows (any version)</p>

  <h2>Tools required</h2>

  <p>No software tools are required for this test.</p>

  <p>Note that this is a visual test. There should be no assistive technologies
  (such as screen readers or screen magnifiers) running during the execution of
  this test case, since those products generally intercept keyboard
  functions.</p>

  <h3>Test Case Instructions</h3>

  <p>In the Firefox application, the install process, and the uninstall
  process, go through all menu options and dialogs provided by the software
  user interface. Note: During the install process, it is important to include
  navigation of the license agreement.</p>

  <p>Verify that all of the following items can be accessed using just the
  keyboard (i.e., without using the mouse).</p>

  <h4><a name="system-menu" id="system-menu">Navigating the System
  Menu (Alt + Spacebar)</a></h4>

  <p>The system menu is the pulldown box associated with the title bar icon in
  the upper left corner of the application. It contains options to move,
  resize, minimize, and maximize the application. Use the following techniques
  to navigate the system menu.</p>

  <ol class="techniques">
    <li>Press <kbd>Alt + Spacebar</kbd> to access system menu</li>

    <li>Use <kbd>Arrow Keys</kbd> to move from option to option.</li>

    <li>Verify that there is a clear visual indication as to which option has
    current focus at all times.</li>

    <li>Verify keyboard shortcuts when available, as indicated by underlined
    letters in the menu options.</li>
  </ol>

  <h4><a name="menu-bar" id="menu-bar">Navigating Menu Bar options
  (Alt)</a></h4>

  <p>The menu bar is a series of pulldown menus directly below the title bar at
  the top of the application window. It usually has options like "File",
  "Edit", "View", and so on. Usually, each menu bar option can be selected to
  view a pulldown of related menu items. Use the following techniques to
  navigate through all of the menu bar options.</p>

  <ol class="techniques">
    <li>Press <kbd>Alt</kbd> to access menu bar.</li>

    <li>Use <kbd>Arrow Keys</kbd> to move from option to option.</li>

    <li>Verify that there is a clear visual indication as to which option has
    current focus at all times.</li>

    <li>Verify all options can be selected using the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key.</li>

    <li>Verify mnemonic access keys are available for each menu item, as
    indicated by underlined letters in the menu options, and that the key works
    properly. For example, after opening the "File" menu, you can press the
    "<kbd>V</kbd>" key to open the Print Pre<kbd class="accesskey">v</kbd>iew
    window.</li>

    <li>Verify shortcut (accelerator) keys when available (keys that do not
    require you to actually open the menu bar pulldown, such as
    <kbd>Ctrl+R</kbd> to reload the current Web page.</li>

    <li>Verify submenus can be opened and closed using <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd>
    and <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> keys. If the currently highlighted item has no
    submenu, pressing the <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> key should cause the current
    menu pulldown to close and open the next item in the menu bar.</li>

    <li>Verify the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key closes submenus and eventually returns
    focus to original focus location, before <kbd>Alt</kbd> was originally
    pressed.</li>
  </ol>

  <h4><a name="tool-bar" id="tool-bar">Navigating Toolbars</a></h4>

  <p>A toolbar is a row of icons across the top of the window, just below the
  menu bar.</p>

  <p>The toolbar in many applications is not keyboard accessible; i.e., there
  is no way to use the keyboard to move focus to the icons in the toolbar. As
  of version 1.5, the toolbar in the Firefox application is not keyboard
  accessible. In this case, the following test must be done:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>For applications where the toolbar is not keyboard accessible:

      <ol class="techniques">
        <li>Verify that <span>for every icon that can be displayed
        in the toolbar</span>, the icon's function can be accessed using
        another keyboard accessible method. For example, the "Back" button
        function can be accessed by pressing <kbd>Alt+Left Arrow</kbd>, and the
        "Refresh" button function can be accessed by pressing
        <kbd>Ctrl+R</kbd>.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>In the future, if Firefox supports keyboard access to the toolbar, use the
  following techniques to test the toolbar.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>For applications where the toolbar is keyboard accessible:

      <ol class="techniques">
        <li>Verify Toolbars can be accessed from the keyboard. The Toolbar
        might be part of the <kbd>Tab</kbd> ring, or access to the toolbar
        could be implemented using another keystroke combination.</li>

        <li>Verify that either <kbd>Tab</kbd> or the <kbd>Arrow keys</kbd> will
        move from one toolbar option to another. If Tab is used, then
        <kbd>Shift+Tab</kbd> should work in the reverse direction.</li>

        <li>Verify that there is a clear visual indication as to which option
        currently has focus at all times.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4><a name="app-dialog" id="app-dialog">Navigating Application
  Dialogs</a></h4>

  <p>Application dialogs include any application windows that are not part of
  the main Firefox browser window. This includes any windows that open as a
  result of selecting options in the menu pulldowns, such as the Open File
  dialog, of the Organize Bookmarks dialog. This also includes all of the
  dialogs in the install and the uninstall process.</p>

  <p>Use the following techniques to test navigation of application
  dialogs.</p>

  <ol class="techniques">
    <li>Verify that the initial keyboard focus, when dialog is first opened, is
    in a logical place (probably upper left-most element in the dialog).</li>

    <li>Verify <kbd>Tab</kbd> key can be used to move from option to option,
    and <kbd>Shift+Tab</kbd> moves in reverse order.</li>

    <li>Verify that there is a clear visual indication as to which option
    currently has focus at all times.</li>

    <li>Verify that all user controls can be reached using the <kbd>Tab</kbd>
    key or <kbd>Arrow keys</kbd>.</li>

    <li>Verify <em>Tab Order</em> is logical. As you tab from option to option,
    keyboard focus should follow a logical progression, just as with the visual
    presentation. Each page is unique, so use your judgment to decide if the
    order is logical. It may be that left to right, and top to bottom makes
    most sense. If there are columns of information, perhaps moving down each
    column, then up to the top of the next column makes sense.</li>

    <li>Verify the <em>Tab Ring</em>, i.e., press <kbd>Tab</kbd> till you reach
    the last item in the dialog, then press <kbd>Tab</kbd> again to verify that
    focus moves back to the first item in the dialog. Conversely, press
    <kbd>Shift+Tab</kbd> till you reach the first item, then press
    <kbd>Shift+Tab</kbd> again to verify that focus rings back to the last item
    in the dialog.</li>
  </ol>

  <h4><a name="app-win-tab-browse" id=
  "app-win-tab-browse">Navigating the Application window, including Tabbed
  Browsing</a></h4>

  <p>Application windows or dialogs may be organized into sections, panes,
  frames, notebook tabs, and so on. For example, Firefox version 1.5 uses
  notebook tabs to organize information on some of the Options dialog menus.
  Firefox also allows several Web pages, to be displayed, each in its own
  notebook tab within the Firefox application window. This is known as "Tabbed
  Browsing". It must be possible to move from one notebook tab to the next
  using the keyboard.</p>

  <p>Use the following techniques to test navigation between tabbed browser
  windows and other types of window sections.</p>

  <ol class="techniques">
    <li>Verify that all parts of the application window can be accessed via the
    keyboard.

      <ul>
        <li>Commonly, <kbd>F6</kbd> is used to move between sections, panes and
        frames)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Verify notebook tabs can be navigated using <kbd>Ctrl+Tab</kbd> to
    change from one notebook tab to another.

      <ul>
        <li><kbd>Ctrl+Tab</kbd> is used to navigate between notebook tabs, both
        in application dialogs such as the Firefox Options dialog, and in the
        Firefox Tabbed Browsing feature. When testing the Tabbed Browsing, it
        will be necessary to open multiple Web pages, each in its own tab, to
        test this feature. Use the New Tab option in the File menu pulldown
        (<kbd>Ctrl+T</kbd>) to open new Web page notebook tabs in the
        browser.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Verify that there is a clear visual indication as to which part of the
    application has current focus.</li>
  </ol>

  <h4><a name="context-menu" id="context-menu">Navigating Context
  menus</a></h4>

  <p>A context menu is a popup box of options displayed when user clicks the
  right mouse button on a user interface element, such as an icon. If there are
  any elements that support a context menu, use the following techniques to
  test navigation of the context menu.</p>

  <ol class="techniques">
    <li>Verify the context menu can be opened using standard Windows key
    <kbd>Shift+F10</kbd>.</li>

    <li>Verify <kbd>Arrow keys</kbd> can be used to move between items in
    context menu.</li>

    <li>Verify that there is a clear visual indication as to which option
    currently has focus at all times.</li>

    <li>Verify all context menu items can be selected using the
    <kbd>Enter</kbd> key.</li>
  </ol>

  <h4><a name="ui-elements" id="ui-elements">Navigating User
  Interface Elements and Controls</a></h4>

  <p>There are many user interface elements that are commonly found in
  application dialogs, such as push buttons, radio buttons, lists, and many
  more. Some common elements are listed here, with keystrokes used to interact
  with those elements. Use these techniques to verify the operation of user
  interface elements in all application dialogs.</p>

  <ol class="techniques">
    <li><span>Push Buttons</span>: Verify push buttons are
    selectable with either the <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Spacebar</kbd>
    key.</li>

    <li><span>Check boxes</span>: Verify <kbd>Spacebar</kbd> will
    select/deselect a check box.</li>

    <li><span>Radio buttons</span>: Verify <kbd>Tab</kbd> moves from
    one radio button group to the next element, and <kbd>Arrow keys</kbd> move
    from one radio button to another within a group.</li>

    <li><span>Read-Only text fields</span>: Text boxes, such as the
    license agreement during the install process, must be tested to ensure that
    the entire text area can be viewed. Verify <kbd>Tab</kbd> moves to and from
    the text field. If Scroll Bars are present, verify the <kbd>Arrow
    keys</kbd> will scroll the text up, down, right, and left, as
    appropriate.</li>

    <li>
      <span>Text input fields</span>:

      <ol class="inputfields">
        <li>Verify <kbd>Tab</kbd> moves to and from the input field. (If tabs
        are allowed within the field, another method of exiting the field must
        be provided.)</li>

        <li>Verify editable text can be selected using <kbd>Shift+Arrow</kbd>
        keys, in text input fields. (For example, use <kbd>Shift+Arrow</kbd> to
        select, then <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> to copy to clipboard,
        then <kbd>Ctrl+V</kbd> to paste from clipboard.)</li>

        <li>Verify that <kbd>Enter</kbd> causes the default action for the
        dialog to be activated, if appropriate.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li><span>Spin boxes</span>: Verify <kbd>Up</kbd> and <kbd>Down
    Arrow</kbd> keys can increase or decrease the value of the spin box.</li>

    <li><span>Tree views</span>: Verify branches of tree views can
    be opened with <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd>, and closed with <kbd>Left
    Arrow</kbd> keys.</li>

    <li><span>Drop down boxes</span>: Verify drop down box can be
    opened with <kbd>Alt+Down Arrow</kbd>.</li>

    <li><span>Default Action</span>: If the dialog has a default
    action associated with it, such as a "Submit" button, or a "Next" button,
    verify that pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> will activate the default action from
    anywhere within that dialog. (Except, of course, when selecting a
    non-default action in the dialog.) For example, if keyboard focus is in a
    text input field (such as Name, Address, etc.) then pressing the
    <kbd>Enter</kbd> key might activate the submit button. Or, in the install
    process, pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> might activate the "Next" button, to
    continue to the next install dialog page.</li>

    <li><span>Any other user interface elements</span> should be
    usable with standard and intuitive keystrokes.</li>
  </ol>
