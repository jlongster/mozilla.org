  <h1>Accessibility QA Test Case: Keyboard Navigation and Visual Focus of
  Web Content in Firefox</h1>

  <p>Firefox Web Content on Microsoft Windows: Keyboard navigation of Web
  content with no Assistive Technology software running.</p>

  <h2 id="tab-o-contents">Description</h2>

  <p>This test case describes the approach and methods used to test
  keyboard navigation and keyboard functions in a web page displayed in the
  Windows version of Firefox. Be sure to follow the <a href=
  "#Test_Case_Setup">test case setup instructions</a> before proceeding
  with this test case.</p>

  <p>The following types of functions will be tested. You can select the
  provided link for each to go directly to the section</p>

  <ol class="toc">
    <li><a href="#scroll-bars">Scroll bars</a>: Scroll up/down and
    right/left on web pages that are too large to fit in the browser
    window.</li>

    <li><a href="#links">Links</a>: Tab to text links and image links in a
    web page and use the keyboard to select the links.</li>

    <li><a href="#java-scripts">JavaScripts</a>: Test simple JavaScript
    functions</li>

    <li><a href="#html-forms">HTML Form fields and controls</a>: Navigate
    form entry fields and controls with the keyboard.</li>

    <li><a href="#html-frames">HTML Frames</a>: Navigate frames with the
    keyboard.</li>

    <li><a href="#dhtml">DHTML controls</a>: Navigate DHTML elements with
    the keyboard.</li>

    <li><a href="#caret-browsing">Caret Browsing</a>: Navigate the page in
    Caret Browsing mode, use keyboard functions like cut/paste.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>This test case is based on the <a class="ex-ref" href=
  "http://www-03.ibm.com/able/guidelines/web/accessweb.html">IBM Web
  accessibility checklist</a>, checkpoints 1, 2, 5, 7, and 9.</p>

  <h3>Scope of test</h3>

  <p>The goal is to test a sample of common Web page elements. It is
  perhaps impossible to document every type of Web page element and testing
  techniques for each, so this test case provides some of the common
  elements to be tested. (Testers are encouraged to surf the Web and use
  the techniques described here to test other live Web sites.)</p>

  <p class="note">The techniques discussed in in this test case are
  specifically for Firefox running on the Microsoft Windows operating
  system.</p>

  <h3>Tools required</h3>

  <p>No software tools are required for this test.</p>

  <p>Note that this is a visual test. There should be no assistive
  technologies (such as screen readers or screen magnifiers) running during
  the execution of this test case. Assistive technologies generally provide
  their own keyboard navigation methods when viewing Web pages.</p>

  <h3 id="Test_Case_Setup">Test Case Setup</h3>

  <p>All of these files must be available for this test case. You may save
  them all in a file folder on your PC, or, if you have a Web server, they
  may all be stored in a single directory on the Web server.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>win-webcontent-kbnav.html (This is the file you are reading right
    now.)</li>

    <li>groovyimg.jpg</li>

    <li>imgmap1.jpg</li>
  </ol>

  <h3 class="c1">Test Case Instructions</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Open this file with Firefox.

      <ul>
        <li>Use any method you prefer to open this file. For example, with
        Firefox started, you can start the "Open file" dialog by pressing
        <kbd>Ctrl + O</kbd>, or by selecting "Open file" from the File menu
        bar pulldown.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Using the Firefox browser, scroll down through this file and follow
    the instructions written in each section. <span class="important">Do
    not use the mouse during the execution of this test case, except where
    noted.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h4 id="scroll-bars">Testing Scroll bars</h4>

  <h5>Rationale for testing Scroll Bars</h5>

  <p>This Web page, like many on the Web, are too large to be seen in their
  entirety within the Web browser window. Because many users cannot use a
  mouse, we must test to be sure it is possible to scroll through all of
  the Web page content using the keyboard.</p>

  <p>You should see a vertical scroll bar along the right side of this
  browser window, and a horizontal scroll bar along the bottom side of the
  window.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>If you do not see them, then resize the window to a smaller size
    until you see both scroll bars. (You may use the mouse to resize the
    window, if desired.)</li>

    <li>The following horizontal rule has a set width of 120% of the screen
    width, which should force a horizontal scrollbar to display at the
    bottom of the browser window. (If it does not, there is a functional
    problem in the browser!)</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>

  <h5>Steps for testing Scroll Bars</h5>

  <p>Follow these instructions.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Press the <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd> key to scroll down a line at a
    time, and the <kbd>Up Arrow</kbd> key to scroll back up.</li>

    <li>Press the <kbd>Page Up</kbd> and <kbd>Page Down</kbd> keys to
    scroll up and down a page at a time.</li>

    <li>Press the <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> key to scroll to the right, and
    the <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd> key to scroll back to the left.

      <ul>
        <li>Verify that you can use the arrow keys to scroll to parts of
        the Web page not currently visible within the browser window.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <ul>
    <li class="note">Yes, this is pretty trivial, but it's got to be
    done!</li>
  </ul>

  <p>End of Scroll Bar test section.</p>

  <h4 id="links">Testing Link Navigation</h4>

  <h5>Rationale for testing Link Navigation</h5>

  <p>Many Web pages contain links to other Web pages, or links to other
  sections within the same Web page. There are many ways to implement these
  links. Two of the most common are text links and image links, where a
  mouse user would "click" on either a string of text or on a graphic image
  to follow the link. Because many people cannot use the mouse, or just
  prefer to use the keyboard, users must be able to navigate to these links
  using only the keyboard.</p>

  <p>The <kbd>Tab</kbd> key is used to navigate to links on a Web page.
  (The tab key is also used to navigate to other user controls in a Web
  page, such as input fields and buttons in forms.) When you press the
  <kbd>Tab</kbd> key, focus will jump to the next link or control.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>When the browser first loads a Web page, the initial keyboard focus
    for the page should be at the top of the page.</li>

    <li>When you press <kbd>Tab</kbd> for the first time on a page,
    keyboard focus should move to the first link or control at the top of
    the page.</li>

    <li>Remember that the links on the page may not be visible. Often, for
    example, the first link on a page is a "skip to main content" link,
    which is provided to allow users to skip over banner images and Web
    site navigation links and jump directly to the main content of the
    current page. The "skip to main content" link is often attached to an
    invisible image, since it is not generally used by sighted users. (More
    often, "skip to main content" is used by blind users who are using a
    screen reader,</li>
  </ul>

  <h5 id="start-link-test">Steps for testing Link Navigation</h5>

  <ol>
    <li>Click here to <a href="#start-link-test">set keyboard focus to the
    Link Navigation steps</a>. Just this once, you may use the mouse for
    this, if you wish. We just want to place keyboard focus at a known
    location, since there is no way of knowing what keys you pressed before
    you got to this test. FYI... clicking on the link in this step will
    move the keyboard focus to the "Steps for testing Links" header, just
    above.)</li>

    <li>Press the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key once. Verify that you see a
    dotted-line box around the words "Click on this link". The dotted line
    is a "visual focus indicator". Any time you press <kbd>Tab</kbd> in a
    We page, a clear visual focus indicator should show the location of the
    current keyboard focus.</li>

    <li>Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> one more time. You should see the visual focus
    move to the following image link: <a href=
      "#start-link-test"><img alt="Groovy Image Link Button" src=
      "groovyimg.jpg" height="66" width="69"></a>

      <ul>
        <li>Verify that you see a clear visual focus indicator (dotted
        line) around the image. (As you will see, the visual focus
        indicator will be clearer for some objects than it is for others...
        but there must be a visual indicator of some sort.)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> seven more times. You should see the visual
    focus move to the following client-side image map. There are 7 mapped
    areas in this image, corresponding to the different colored bands.<br>

      <img alt=
      "image map containing links to various sections of this document."
      src="imgmap1.jpg" usemap="#ImgNav_Map1" height="39" width="618">

      <ul>
        <li>Verify that you see a clear visual focus indicator (dotted
        line) around each section of the image each time you press
        <kbd>Tab</kbd>.</li>

        <li>(Note that as of the time this test case was written, this
        visual focus test fails on the image map area with a black
        background. Bugzilla bug <a href=
        "https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=338033">338033</a>
        has been written against this bug.)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Next, display the context menu and properties for one of the image
    map links above, using these steps.

      <ul>
        <li>Press <kbd>Shift + Tab</kbd> until focus is on the "Forms" link
        in the image map above. You will see the dotted-line visual focus
        indicator around the word "Forms".</li>

        <li>Press <kbd>Shift + F10</kbd> to display the context menu. You
        should see the context menu, listing several link-related options.
        The last item in the menu should be <span class=
        "c3">P</span>roperties.</li>

        <li>Verify that the context menu is the same as the context menu
        displayed when you press the right mouse button on the same
        image.</li>

        <li>Press <kbd>P</kbd> to select the Properties option. Verify that
        you see the properties dialog window pop up.</li>

        <li>Verify these properties are listed in the properties dialog:

          <ul>
            <li><kbd>Alt</kbd> = <span class="c4">Forms</span></li>

            <li><span class="c4">Title</span> = <span class="c4">Html Forms
            navigation test techniques</span></li>
          </ul>

          <p class="note">The above properties correspond to the "Alt=" and
          "Title=" attributes specified in the image map tags for the Forms
          section of the image map. If you view the page source for this
          page, you will see similar properties set for the other image map
          areas, if you wish to verify those also.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Press <kbd>Esc</kbd> to close the properties window. Verify
        that visual focus returns to the Forms link (back where you
        started). Press and <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift + Tab</kbd> to
        verify that keyboard focus returned to the Forms link.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h4 id="java-scripts">Testing Simple JavaScripts</h4>

  <p>This section contains some simple JavaScripts, with instructions on
  how to test them with the keyboard. Please feel free to find other more
  complex JavaScript examples on other Web pages on the net, and test the
  ability to use those JavaScripts in Firefox.</p>

  <h5>Javascript: Onkeypress alert</h5>

  <p>In this example, both "onkeypress" and "onclick" events are coded, and
  different alerts are displayed depending on which action is taken.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <kbd>Tab</kbd> to the "Tab here and press Enter..." sentence below.

      <ul>
        <li>Verify that you see a clear visual focus indicator (dotted
        line) around the text.</li>

        <li>(Note that as of the time this test case was written, this
        visual focus test fails. Bugzilla bug <a href=
        "https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=338035">338035</a>
        has been written against this bug.)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to activate the onkeypress event.

      <ul>
        <li>Verify that an alert box is displayed, with the words "You
        pressed enter".</li>

        <li>Select "OK" to clear the alert box.</li>

        <li>(If you click the mouse on the sentence, you will activate the
        "onclick" event, and a different message will display.)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p class="c6">&gt; <span class="c5" onclick=
  "alert('You clicked the mouse. Onclick was activated');" onkeypress=
  "if (event.keyCode == 13) { alert('You pressed Enter. Onkeypress was activated.');};">
  <a tabindex="0" name="keypress-example" id="keypress-example">Tab here
  and press Enter for onKeyPress alert.</a></span> &lt;</p>
  <hr>

  <h5>Javascript: Jump to selected destination</h5>

  <p>In the following example, the Go button activates the Javascript to
  jump to the selected destination.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Tab to the "Select a destination" pulldown.</li>

    <li>Press the <kbd>Arrow keys</kbd> (up or down) to select a
    destination.

      <ul>
        <li>Verify the arrow keys cause different selections to display in
        the field.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>With focus in the "Select a destination" pulldown, press <kbd>Alt +
    Down Arrow</kbd>.

      <ul>
        <li>Verify the selection pulldown is displayed.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> again to move to the Go button.</li>

    <li>Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to activate the JavaScript.</li>

    <li>Verify that focus moves to the selected jump destination using both
    of these methods:

      <ul>
        <li>Visually verify that the selected destination is displayed in
        the browser.</li>

        <li>Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to verify that the keyboard focus starts
        jumping from the selected destination. (In other words, make sure
        the keyboard focus is not still set on the Go button in this
        JavaScript section.)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h5>Javascript: Popup current time</h5>

  <p>The following button will cause a popup window to display the time. It
  interacts with a continuously running JavaScript that starts when this
  page is first loaded.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><kbd>Tab</kbd> to the button below.</li>

    <li>Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to activate the button.</li>

    <li>Verify that a pop-up message is displayed, with the current

  <h4 id="html-forms">Testing HTML Form fields and controls</h4>

  <p>The following form contains a variety of HTML form options.
  Instructions are included for navigating the form fields and
  controls.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Click here to <a href="#pre-form-point">set keyboard focus to the
    HTML Form testing section</a>. This is another of those rare times when
    you may use the mouse, if you wish. This will place keyboard focus to a
    spot just before the beginning of the HTML form found below. (Then
    return to keyboard navigation!)</li>
  </ol>

  <h4 id="html-frames">Testing HTML Frames</h4>

  <p>Some web pages use frames to separate different areas of the page,
  like window-panes within a large window. The <kbd>F6</kbd> and <kbd>Shift
  + F6</kbd> keys are used to move from one frame to another in the web
  page.</p>

  <p>We will link to a sample page at the w3schools web site to display and
  test a page implemented with frames.</p>

  <p>Follow these steps when testing keyboard navigation of frames. Because
  you need to open a new web page, it might be best to read all of these
  instructions before proceeding. (Note that these instructions also make
  use of Firefox's Tabbed Browsing capability.)</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Open the following web page with Firefox:

      <ul>
        <li>Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to focus on the w3schools link below.</li>

        <li>Press <kbd>Shift + F10</kbd> to open the context menu for the
        link.</li>

        <li>Press <kbd>T</kbd> to select the "Open Link in New <span class=
        "c3">T</span>ab" option. Verify that a new web page notebook tab is
        created at the top of the Firefox window. It has a title that
        starts "Tryit Editor..."</li>

        <li>Press <kbd>Ctrl + Tab</kbd> to switch to the "Tryit Editor..."
        notebook tab. (You can press <kbd>Shift + Ctrl + Tab</kbd> to
        return to this page to review the instructions.)</li>

        <li>Link to <strong><a href=
        "http://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_frame_cols">
        Frames example at w3schools web site</a></strong></li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>When the page loads, press <kbd>F6</kbd> several times.

      <ul>
        <li>Watch the focus carefully. Verify that you see a clear visual
        focus indicator when focus moves to each frame. You should see a
        dotted line around the edge of each frame when it has focus.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Then press <kbd>Shift + F6</kbd> several times.

      <ul>
        <li>Watch the focus carefully. Verify that you see a clear visual
        focus indicator when focus moves to each frame. You should see a
        dotted line around the edge of each frame when it has focus.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>When you are done verifying the keyboard navigation and visual
    focus of the frames on the w3schools page, press <kbd>Ctrl + W</kbd> to
    close that notebook tab.

      <ul>
        <li>Verify that the notebook tab containing the Frames example page
        closes, and focus returns to this page, at the same point in the
        page where you left it.</li>

  provided below to load those example pages.</p>

  <p>The examples do not contain detailed information on how to navigate
  the DHTML elements. For now, just verify that you can use the

  <h4 id="caret-browsing">Testing Caret Browsing and the system clipboard
  function</h4>

  <p>Firefox provides a little-known feature called Caret Browsing. When in
  Caret Browsing mode, you can navigate a Web page in a way similar to
  navigating a document in a word processor. Visually, you see an insertion
  caret (cursor) on the page, and you can use the <kbd>Arrow keys</kbd> to
  move up, down, left, and right, one line or character at a time. In this
  mode, you can use the keyboard to select text and copy it into the system
  clipboard. When not in Caret browsing mode, you can select specific parts
  of the page text only with the mouse.</p>

  <p>Follow these instructions to verify the basic functions of Caret
  Browsing.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Press <kbd>F7</kbd> to start Caret Browsing mode. Select the "Yes"
    button in the resulting popup (if it displays) to complete the switch
    to Caret Browsing mode.

      <ul>
        <li>Verify that the location of the keyboard focus (the "caret", or
        cursor) is clear when Caret Browsing mode starts.</li>

        <li>(The caret is a vertical, blinking line. If the location of the
        caret is not obvious, you may need to press the <kbd>Up Arrow</kbd>
        or <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd> key and watch closely to find the
        caret.)</li>

        <li>Continue to the next step when you have visually located the
        caret.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Press the <kbd>Up Arrow</kbd> key, then the <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd>
    key.

      <ul>
        <li>Verify the caret moves up one line at a time, or down one line
        at a time, depending on which arrow key was pressed.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Press the <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> key, then the <kbd>Left
    Arrow</kbd> key.

      <ul>
        <li>Verify the caret moves right or left one character at a time,
        depending on which arrow key was pressed.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Press the <kbd>Page Up</kbd> key, then the <kbd>Page Down</kbd>
    key.

      <ul>
        <li>Verify the page moves up and down, as expected.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Press the <kbd>Home</kbd> key.

      <ul>
        <li>Verify the caret moves to the beginning of the current line
        (left edge of the browser window) when you press
        <kbd>Home</kbd>.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Press the <kbd>End</kbd> key.

      <ul>
        <li>Verify the caret moves to the end of the current line when you
        press <kbd>Esc</kbd>.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Press <kbd>Ctrl + Home</kbd>.

      <ul>
        <li>Verify the browser displays the top of the page, and the caret
        moves to the upper left corner of the page.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Press <kbd>Ctrl + End</kbd>.

      <ul>
        <li>Verify the browser displays the bottom of the page, and the
        caret moves to the end of the last line of the page.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Press the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key and the <kbd>Shift + Tab</kbd> key.

      <ul>
        <li>Verify that focus moves between links and form controls, just
        as when you tested them in non-Caret Browsing mode.</li>

        <li>Note these exceptions: If an <kbd>Arrow key</kbd> has a
        specific function in the area where the caret is currently located,
        you may need to use the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key to to navigate away from
        that area. For example, in a radio button group, the <kbd>Arrow
        keys</kbd> are used to move from one selection to another. If you
        Tab to the radio button group in the form (in the forms testing
        section, above), you cannot use the <kbd>Arrow keys</kbd> to move
        the cursor back to the text above or below the radio buttons. You
        must press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to move out of the radio button group,
        then the <kbd>Arrow keys</kbd> will again move the caret up, down,
        left, or right, as expected in Caret Browsing mode.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Test copy and paste to the system clipboard:

      <ul>
        <li>Press the <kbd>Arrow keys</kbd> to a text area in this
        page.</li>

        <li>While holding down the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key, press the
        <kbd>Arrow keys</kbd> to select a section of text. (The left and
        right arrow keys will select text one character at a time, while
        the up and down arrow keys will select a line at a time.)</li>

        <li>After highlighting the desired text, press <kbd>Ctrl + C</kbd>
        to copy the text into the system clipboard.</li>

        <li>Press the <kbd>Tab</kbd> or <kbd>Shift + Tab</kbd> keys to move
        to the text area box, below. (Note that you <strong>must</strong>
        tab into the text area box in order to edit the contents of the
        box. If you use the arrow keys to enter the box, you will remain in
        "read only" mode, and you will not be allowed to edit (or paste)
        text in the box.)</li>

        <li>Press <kbd>Ctrl + V</kbd> to paste the clipboard text into the
        box.

          <ul>
            <li>Verify that the text is pasted properly into the text
            area.</li>
          </ul>

          <form action="" method="post">
            <p><label for="paste-test" class="c14">Text entry area for

          </form>
        </li>

        <li>If you feel adventurous, you can also try to paste some text
        into the Name field in <a href="#pre-form-point">sample form in the
        forms testing section</a> of this test case. Or, start your
        favorite word processor and verify that you can paste the text
        selected from the Firefox browser window into a word processor
        document, to verify the "system" clipboard is being used properly.
        Use the cursor to select different elements in this page: text,
        form fields, graphics, links... and see how they make the
        transition to the word processor document.</li>
      </ul>
