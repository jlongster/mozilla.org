  <h1>Accessibility QA Test Case: Firefox - Windows keyboard accessibility
  features</h1>

  <p>Firefox user interface on Microsoft Windows: Windows keyboard
  accessibility function support</p>

  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>This test case describes the approach and methods used to verify that
  Firefox does not interfere with keyboard accessibility features built into
  the operating system. For Microsoft Windows, the following keyboard
  accessibility features will be tested.</p>

  <ul class="toc">
    <li><a href="#sticky-keys">Sticky Keys</a></li>

    <li><a href="#filter-keys">Filter Keys</a></li>

    <li><a href="#toggle-keys">Toggle Keys</a></li>

    <li><a href="#mouse-keys">Mouse Keys</a></li>

    <li><a href="#other-keys">Standard Microsoft Windows keystrokes</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>This test case is based on IBM Software Accessibility Checklist version
  3.5.1, <a class="ex-ref" href=
  "http://www.ibm.com/able/guidelines/software/swkbdaccess.html">checkpoint
  1.2</a>.</p>

  <h2>Scope of test</h2>

  <p>This test is to verify that Firefox does not interfere with the operation
  of the operating system's keyboard accessibility features. These features
  will be tested at random places in the Firefox application, install process,
  and uninstall process.</p>

  <p>Note: This test should be run for a sampling of Firefox menu items and
  dialogs.</p>

  <h2>Test Environment2</h2>

  <p>Operating system: Microsoft Windows (any version).</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Use the Windows help functions to see whether Windows support for these
    accessibility features has changed in the version of Windows used.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Tools required</h2>

  <p>No software tools are required for this test.</p>

  <p>There should be no assistive technologies (such as screen readers or
  screen magnifiers) running during the execution of this test case.</p>

  <h3>Test Case Instructions</h3>

  <p>The following sections describe testing to be done for the various Windows
  keyboard accessibility features.</p>

  <h4><a name="setup-info" id="setup-info">Setup information</a></h4>

  <p>Various keyboard features will need to be configured for this test case.
  Here is how to open the accessibility options dialog in Windows.</p>

  <ol class="c1">
    <li>To open the Windows Accessibility Options dialog:

      <ul>
        <li>Open the Windows <span>Start</span> menu</li>

        <li>select <span>Control Panel</span></li>

        <li>then select <span>Accessibility Options</span>.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Select the <kbd>Keyboard tab</kbd> to configure the following features:

      <ul>
        <li>Sticky Keys, Filter Keys, and Toggle Keys</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Select the <span>Mouse tab</span> to configure the following feature:

      <ul>
        <li>Mouse Keys</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h4><a name="sticky-keys" id="sticky-keys">Test Sticky Keys</a></h4>

  <h5>Description of Sticky Keys</h5>

  <p>The Sticky Keys feature provides the ability to use multiple key
  combinations by pressing only one key at a time. For example, when pressing
  <span>Alt+F</span> to open the File menu bar pulldown, a user would normally
  hold the <span>Alt</span> key down, then press the <span>F</span> key, and
  finally release both keys at the same time. With Sticky Keys active, the user
  can press and release the <span>Alt</span> key, and then press the
  <span>F</span> key to complete the keystroke, so that only one key is
  physically held down at a time.</p>

  <p>Only certain keys act as "sticky" keys. These are the keys that are used
  to modify the function of other keys on the keyboard. When pressed, these
  keys will remain in the depressed (or "stuck") state, until another
  non-sticky-key is pressed. You can have more than one sticky key in its
  depressed state at once... this allows sequences like <kbd>Ctrl+Alt+Del</kbd>
  to be accomplished by users who can press only one key at a time.</p>

  <p>The operating system will allow the following keys to "stick".</p>

  <ol class="c1">
    <li><kbd>Alt</kbd></li>

    <li><kbd>Ctrl</kbd></li>

    <li><kbd>Shift</kbd></li>

    <li><kbd>Windows Logo Key</kbd> (if the keyboard is so equipped)</li>
  </ol>

  <h5>Testing Sticky Keys</h5>

  <p>Choose at least one multiple-key combination from each menu pulldown list
  (File, View, etc.) and verify that they key combination can be activated
  <span>by pressing only one key at a time</span>, with Sticky Keys activated,
  as described here. (Some specific examples are described in the steps
  below.)</p>

  <ol class="c1">
    <li>In the "Use StickyKeys", settings dialog, select all sticky key
    options.

      <ul class="deeplynested">
        <li>(Hint: the Settings button for Use StickyKeys is on the Keyboard
        tab of the Accessibility Options dialog.)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>With the Firefox application window in focus, activate Sticky Keys
    using the keyboard shortcut:

      <ol>
        <li>Press the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key five (5) times to activate sticky
        keys.</li>

        <li>Verify that the sticky keys activation window pops up, and a chirp
        is heard from the PC speakers when the sticky keys function is
        activated.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li><span>Menu pulldowns</span>: Open each of the applications menu
    pulldowns using only one finger to press the <kbd>Alt + access key
    combination</kbd>. (For example, press the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key, then press
    the <kbd>F</kbd> key to open the file menu pulldown, <kbd>Alt</kbd>, then
    <kbd>E</kbd> for edit, and so on.) Verify that each menu pulldown opens
    properly.</li>

    <li>
      <span>Shortcut keys</span>: Test at least one shortcut key combination
      from each menu pulldown, if one exists. Verify that the shortcut key can
      be activated by pressing only one key at a time (one finger). At minimum,
      test these shortcuts:<br>

      <ol>
        <li><kbd>Ctrl+N</kbd> Open new window</li>

        <li><kbd>Ctrl+T</kbd> Open new tab</li>

        <li><kbd>Ctrl+L</kbd> Open new location</li>

        <li><kbd>Ctrl+F</kbd> Find on this page</li>

        <li><kbd>Ctrl+R</kbd> Reload page</li>

        <li><kbd>Alt+LeftArrow</kbd> Back</li>

        <li><kbd>Alt+RightArrow</kbd> Forward</li>

        <li><kbd>Alt+Home</kbd> Load Home page</li>

        <li><kbd>Ctrl+H</kbd> History</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>When complete, go to Windows accessibility options and deactivate
    Sticky Keys.

      <ul class="deeplynested">
        <li>Alternatively, press the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key 5 times to turn off
        Sticky Keys</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h4><a name="filter-keys" id="filter-keys">Test Filter Keys</a></h4>

  <h5>Description of Filter Keys</h5>

  <p>Filter Keys can be used to control the keyboard in the following ways.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><span>Ignore repeated keystrokes</span> - If a user accidentally
    presses a key more than once within a specified period, the system will act
    as if the key was pressed only once.</li>

    <li><span>Ignore quick keystrokes</span> - The system will ignore all
    keystrokes unless the key is pressed down for a specified period. If a user
    accidentally presses keys that were not intended, the system will ignore
    them.</li>

    <li><span>Set the repeat delay</span> - When a user presses a key and holds
    it down, the system first accepts the key as a single keystroke. After a
    specified time, the key will start to repeat. The period between the time
    the keystroke is first accepted, and the time the keystroke begins to
    repeat, is called the repeat delay.</li>

    <li><span>Set the repeat rate</span> - When a key is held down and begins
    to repeat, the repeat rate specifies the rate at which the key should be
    repeated by the system.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Testing Filter Keys</h5>

  <p>Each of the above Filter Key options must be tested. However, not every
  element in the Firefox application need be tested. These instructions will
  use the Firefox "location" field, but feel free to place keyboard focus in
  any keyboard input field when testing these options.</p>

  <ol class="c1">
    <li>Instructions for testing "Ignore repeated keystrokes"

      <ol>
        <li>Open the "Use FilterKeys" settings dialog and select the following
        options.

          <ul>
            <li>(Hint: the Settings button for Use FilterKeys is on the
            Keyboard tab of the Accessibility Options dialog.)</li>

            <li>Select the Use shortcut option.</li>

            <li>Select the Beep when keys pressed or accepted option.</li>

            <li>Select the Ignore repeated keystrokes checkbox</li>

            <li>Open the Settings dialog for "Ignore repeated keystrokes" and
            take note of the timer value for that option. (The default value is
            0.5 seconds. You may change it to a larger value, if desired.)</li>

            <li>Save the settings and return to the Firefox application.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>With the Firefox application window in focus, activate Filter Keys
        using the keyboard shortcut:

          <ul>
            <li>Press and hold the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key down for eight (8)
            seconds to activate filter keys. Verify that the filter keys
            activation window pops up, and a chirp is heard from the PC
            speakers when filter keys is activated.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Testing the "Ignore Repeat key" option:

          <ul>
            <li>Move focus to location field (you can press <kbd>Ctrl+L</kbd>
            to do this).</li>

            <li>Press any alphanumeric character key on the keyboard.</li>

            <li>Verify that you hear the chirp from the PC speaker when the
            keystroke is accepted.</li>

            <li>Press a key multiple times, at a rate faster than the repeated
            keystroke setting noted above. (If you selected the default, you
            must press the key faster than twice per second.)</li>

            <li>Verify that only the keystroke is accepted only the first time
            the key is pressed, and not for any subsequent pressing of the
            key.</li>

            <li>Press a key at a rate slower than the repeated keystroke
            setting.</li>

            <li>Verify that every subsequent keystroke is accepted, when the
            proper time delay is used.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>Instructions for testing "Ignore quick keystrokes", "Repeat rate", and
    "Repeat delay"

      <ol>
        <li>Open the Settings for FilterKeys dialog and select the following
        options.

          <ol>
            <li>Select the Ignore quick keystrokes and slow down the repeat
            rate checkbox.</li>

            <li>Open the Settings dialog for the Ignore quick
            keystrokes&amp;</li>

            <li>Select "Slot down keyboard repeat rates"</li>

            <li>Select <span>three different values</span> for the timing
            options. For example:

              <ul>
                <li>Set the Repeat delay to 1 second</li>

                <li>Set the Repeat rate to 1.5 seconds</li>

                <li>Set the Slow Keys setting to 2 seconds.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>(You may come back and adjust these rates to more convenient
            settings, as you wish.)</li>

            <li>Save the settings and return to the Firefox application.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li>Testing the Ignore quick keystrokes&amp; etc. options

          <ol>
            <li>Move focus to any text input field in Firefox (e.g., the
            location field).</li>

            <li>Press any key and hold it down until the keystroke is
            accepted.</li>

            <li>Verify that the key is not accepted until the Slow Keys delay
            time has passed (2 seconds, as configured above).</li>

            <li>Press any key and hold it down until the key automatically
            repeats a few times.</li>

            <li>Verify that the Slow Keys delay (2 seconds) passes before the
            key is first accepted.</li>

            <li>Verify that the Repeat delay (1 second) passes after the key is
            first accepted, before it is accepted again (for the first repeat
            of the key).</li>

            <li>Verify that the Repeat rate delay (1.5 seconds) passes between
            each subsequent acceptance of the key.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>When complete, go to Windows accessibility options and deactivate
    Filter Keys.</li>

  <h5>Description of Standard Windows Keys</h5>

  <p>Microsoft Windows defines a number of standard keyboard shortcuts that are
  used by many applications. Firefox should use the same keyboard shortcuts,
  where applicable. Here are some examples:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><kbd>Tab</kbd> - Move forward through options</li>

    <li><kbd>Shift+Tab</kbd> - Move backward through options</li>

    <li><kbd>Ctrl+Tab</kbd> - Move forward through notebook tabs</li>

    <li><kbd>Ctrl+Shift+Tab</kbd> - Move backward through notebook tabs</li>

    <li><kbd>F6</kbd> - Move forward through frames</li>

    <li><kbd>Enter</kbd> - Activate current control (such as
    pushbutton)</li>

    <li><kbd>Spacebar</kbd> - toggle checkbox state (checked or
    unchecked), activated selected pushbutton</li>

    <li><kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> - Copy selected text into system clipboard</li>

    <li><kbd>Ctrl+X</kbd> - Cut selected text into system clipboard</li>

    <li><kbd>Ctrl+V</kbd> - Past text from system clipboard</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This is a short list of examples of Windows keyboard shortcuts. Search the
  Windows Help and Support Center for more information on Windows keyboard
  shortcuts.</p>

  <h5>Testing Standard Windows Keys</h5>

  <p>There are no formal steps for testing Firefox coexistence and
  interoperability with standard Windows keys. In short:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Be aware of the standard Windows keystrokes used for keyboard
    navigation and when activating user control elements in applications (such
    as push buttons and check boxes.</li>

    <li>When navigating the Firefox application with the keyboard, use standard
    Windows keystrokes. If they do not work, it may be a Firefox bug.</li>

    <li>Check the Firefox documentation to see if an alternate keyboard
    shortcut or navigation technique is provided by Firefox.</li>
  </ul>
