  <p>This example requires Firefox 3 or later to work with screen readers -- it uses ARIA properties without namespaces, which is now the correct markup.</p>
  <p>There is a description associated with the entire groupbox, as well as a specific description associated with the button.</p>
  <p>When any control is focused inside the groupbox, where focus was previously outside of the groupbox, the description for the entire groupbox should be read by a screen reader.</p>
  <p>When the button is focused, the description of the button should be read after the button's label and role are read by the screen reader.</p>
  <p>Regression testers should test both tabbing forward and back, to make sure that the groupbox description and button description are both read when the button is the first item focused in the groupbox.</p>
