    <h2>Requirements for Keyboard Accessibility</h2>
    <p>1. Tabbing into and out of plugins.<br>
    </p>
    <p>It is desirable to allow users to tab through HTML content, into plugins that
      contain focusable elements, and out the other side of such plugins back into
      either the surrounding HTML content, or to the browser's UI if there are no
      additional focusable items in the surrounding HTML, or if the plugin is alone
      in the browser window. In the current broken model, once a plugin has focus, a
      keyboard-only user is stuck there.<br>
    </p>
    <p>2. Sharing of accelerator keys</p>
    <p>When a plugin is active, it should have the first shot at most keystrokes.
      However, if the plugin sees a keystroke it does not need, it should be able to
      pass on the keystroke, so that it can bubble back up to the user agent. For
      example, if the plugin does not use Alt+Left and Alt+Right these should find
      their way up to the browser for back/forward navigation. Or, perhaps the user
      has typed Alt by itself. On Windows and Linux, this should be forwarded to the
      user agent so it can focus the menu bar, if the plugin doesn't already have its
      own menu bar. In the current broken model, when a plugin has focus it swallows
      all keystrokes.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Two Different Keyboard Models for Plugins Today<br>
    </h2>
    <p>There are two different keyboard-handling modes for plugins.
    </p>
    <p>1. Focused mode, applicable on Windows, with a non-windowless plugin: the
      plugin has its own HWND, and becomes focused when users click in it or tab into
      it, and from then on receives keyboard events directly.
    </p>
    <p>2. Non-focused mode, applicable for windowless plugins, and all plugins on the
      Mac: the plugin draws into a window maintained by the browser, and never has
      focus from an OS point of view, and thus depends on the browser for keyboard
      input.</p>
    <p>I don't know what Unixen do, but I assume all cases on all OSes fall into one
      of the two modes described above. I also assume that plugins and browsers will
      always be able to determine which of these two modes they are in, based only on
      platform and windowlessness.</p>
    <h2>Proposed API Change - new keyPressEvent<br>
    </h2>
    <p>We propose to handle tabbing using the existing NPP_HandleEvent and
      NPN_HandleEvent mechanisms, via the following new event: <em>keyPressEvent</em></p>
    <p>The keyPressEvent will contain boolean event parameters indicating whether
      alt, ctrl, shift or meta modifier keys were used, along with an unsigned 32 bit
      integer representing key's <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-DOM-Level-3-Events-20010410/events.html#Events-KeyEvent">
        DOM_VK</a> key code, via event parameters<br>
    </p>
    <p>For modifier keys (alt, ctrl, shift, meta) alone, the event will be fired on
      key up. For keys that involve a non-modifier key the event will be fired on key
      down, to attain the appropriate leven of UI responsiveness.<br>
    </p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>How this helps with
      <span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">tabbing
into a plugin</span>:<br>
    </p>
    <p>When the browser wants to give the plugin focus and/or advance the focus
      within the plugin, because a user is currently tabbing, it would forward a
      keyPressEvent event to the plugin&nbsp; for tab or shift+tab.</p>
    <p>If the plugin accepts the tab press, but does not already have the real OS
      focus, it needs to give itself OS focus.<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>How this helps with
      <span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">tabbing
out of a plugin</span>:</p>
    <p>When the plugin receives key down and up events for tab or shift+tab, either
      via the new plugin events or from the OS, and it is already at the end of it's
      tab order, it will send a keyPressEvent up to the browser.</p>
    <br>
    <p>How this helps pass
      <span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">unused keystrokes</span>:</p>
    <p>When the plugin receives a key press event, either from the browser firing
      keyPressEvent in non-focused mode, or from the operating system, it will
      analyze to see if it needs the keystroke. If it does not need the key, it must
      send the key back to the browser via keyPressEvent.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>Return codes for keyPressEvent:</p>
    <p>0: browser or plugin does not understand keyPressEvent</p>
    <p>1: keyPressEvent not used. The browse should never return this when it
      receives a Tab or Shift+Tab, because it should always have a way of accepting
      focus.</p>
    <p>2: keyPressEvent accepted and used<br>
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>The plugin and browser still need to handle getFocusEvent and loseFocusEvent
      as they do now.whenever it received a tab key event that caused focus to pass
      beyond the end of its list of focusable items.<br>
    </p>
