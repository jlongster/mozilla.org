We've made a lot of progress with
Mozilla keyboard usability.
<br>
Here's how you can test:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Download and install a copy of <a
 href="http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mozilla/releases/mozilla1.8a6/mozilla-win32-1.8a6-installer.exe">Mozilla
1.8a6</a> (this is not Firefox). Read the <a
 href="http://www.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla1.8a6/">release notes</a>
if you're interested. These
builds are pretty
stable considering they're only alpha, I'm having very good luck
with them. It doesn't do us any good to get bug reports on older stuff
right now. Our main focus is on the browser itself,
so you you only need to install mailnews or address book if
curious about the other apps.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Happy testing!</li>
</ol>
<h1><a name="moz_issues"></a>Known Mozilla issues</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Cannot tab into frames and iframes.</li>
  <li>Cannot customize the sidebar with the keyboard only</li>
  <li>When focused on a plugin, cannot tab out or use any Mozilla keyboard accelerators</li>
  <li>When there's no plugin, "Click here to get plugin" shows in it's place, but that is not keyboard accessible</li>
</ol>
