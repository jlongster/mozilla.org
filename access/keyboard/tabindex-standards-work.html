    <H2>The problem: today's DHTML pages have bad keyboard accessibility
    </H2>
    <p>
      Example:&nbsp;most DHTML menus don't act like regular menus with respect to
      keyboard access. If you can use the keyboard to get to the menu at all, a
      common mistake is to put each menu item in the tab order (often accomplished by
      making each menu item an &lt;a&gt;).
    </p>
    <p>The correct behavior for menus is that the entire menu should be in the tab
      order once, and arrow key navigation should be supported.&nbsp;This also true
      for other widgets like tree views, grids and tab panels.
    </p>
    <P>
      Unfortunately, it's not easy for HTML authors to do the right thing. For one
      thing, there's no way to programmatically set focus on any element, because the
      W3C HTML DOM 2 specifies that only certain elements have a <code>focus()</code>
      method. There's also no official way to specify that any element can be in the
      tab order.</P>
    <H2>The solution: changes to standard behavior of tabindex</H2>
    <P>Starting with Gecko 1.8 alpha 2,&nbsp;Mozilla&nbsp;follows IE's lead by
      extending the tabindex attribute to allow any element's focusability to be
      altered. By following the <A href="http://http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/dhtml/reference/properties/tabindex.asp">
        IE system for tabindex</A> we're allowing DHTML widgets&nbsp;which are
      already keyboard accessible in IE to also be keyboard accessible in Mozilla.
      Here's an example of a <A href="../samples/span-checkbox">span based checkbox</A> that
      is keyboard&nbsp;accessible in both Mozilla 1.8a2 and IE (although the :before
      rule for the checkbox image doesn't work in IE).</P>
    <P>Ideally this system would also be supported by Opera and Safari -- not only in
      Web Forms 2, but also in HTML. A W3C errata should be published.</P>

    <h3>Notes:</h3>
    <P>In Mozilla one cannot use createEvent(), initEvent() and dispatchEvent() to
      send focus to an element, because DOM focus events are considered informational
      only -- generated by the system after something is focused, but not actually
      used to set focus.</P>
