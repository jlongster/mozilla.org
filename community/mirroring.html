  <p>
    Our file archive is available at 
    <a href="http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org">http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org</a>,
    and our releases archive is available at
    <a href="http://releases.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org">http://releases.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org</a>,
    as well as from a <a href="mirrors.html">number of mirrors</a> all over the world.
    We highly recommend you use one of our mirrors to get the latest Mozilla software.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you would like to mirror the contents of the archives, we offer rsync access to do so.
    We have two different modules available for your use:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>releases-rsync.mozilla.org::mozilla-current/, contains whatever releases are currently generating the most traffic, and content varies depending on what the most recent releases are.  Typically this is the current versions of Firefox and Thunderbird. <b>Size 15-25 GB</b>;</li>
    <li>releases-rsync.mozilla.org::mozilla-releases/, contains several recent versions of Firefox, Thunderbird, SeaMonkey, Sunbird and other Mozilla product releases, as well as Add-ons (extensions, themes, etc), <b>Size: 100-130 GB</b>.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    Use them as follows:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Current releases only:
    <code>
      rsync -a --delete --delete-before releases-rsync.mozilla.org::mozilla-current/ /your/local/mirror/path/
    </code>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    All releases:
    <code>
      rsync -a --delete --delete-before releases-rsync.mozilla.org::mozilla-releases/ /your/local/mirror/path/
    </code>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The mozilla-all module, which is the complete archive (what's visible on
    <a href="http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/">ftp.mozilla.org</a>,
    4.0TB and growing), is no longer publicly available via rsync due to its
    size.  If you really want it all, contact us to make arrangements.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We are currently only accepting HTTP mirrors at this time.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To mirror us correctly, you will need to add the following directives
    to the &lt;VirtualHost&gt; or &lt;Directory&gt; configuration block (if
    you're using Apache HTTPD) for your mirror so that Apple disk images,
    Mozilla XPInstaller packs, partial updates, and JAR files are downloaded
    correctly to end-users' browsers. Users hate it when they click a file
    and get a browser window full of garbage. <b>Our download redirector will
    not send requests to you if you are serving the files with the wrong
    MIME types.</b>
  </p>
  
  
    <pre><code>
      AddType application/x-apple-diskimage dmg
      AddType application/x-xpinstall xpi
      AddType application/x-java-archive jar
      AddType application/octet-stream mar
      AddType application/octet-stream msi
      AddType application/vnd.ms-cab-compressed cab
      AddType application/x-install-instructions install
      AddType application/x-debian-package deb
      AddType application/vnd.android.package-archive apk
    </code></pre>
  
  
  <p>
    Alternately, add "AllowOverride FileInfo" to the appropriate configuration block
    and the <a href="ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/.htaccess">/pub/mozilla.org/.htaccess</a> file
    will add them for you automatically.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you're not using Apache HTTPD, you'll need to make the necessary
    equivalent changes in your server config to make sure the MIME types
    are correct.

    Please set your mirror to update every 15 minutes so we can assure that our
    network of mirrors is as fresh as possible.  We will be monitoring the quality
    of your mirror for responsiveness and validity several times a day.  Currently,
    basic availability checks are run on the most popular files every 5 minutes.
