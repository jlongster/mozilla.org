<h1>Optimization</h1>

<h2>Optimization settings</h2>

<p>The currently supported optimization settings are:</p>

<p><b>-1</b><br>
Interpretive mode is always used. The compilation time is minimized 
at the expense of runtime performance. No class files are generated, 
which may improve memory usage depending on your system. Another 
benefit of the interpreted mode is that the interpreter performs 
tail-call elimination of recursive functions. Also, you must use 
this optimization level if your code uses Continuation objects.</p>

<p>If the optimization package is not available, then optimization 
acts as if it is always -1.</p>

<p><b>0</b><br>
No optimizations are performed. The bytecode compiler runs fastest 
in this mode, but the generated byte code is less efficient.</p>

<p><b>1-9</b><br>
All optimizations are performed. Simple data &amp; type 
flow analysis is performed to determine which JavaScript 
variables can be allocated to Java VM registers, and which 
variables are used only as Numbers. Local common sub-expressions 
are collapsed (currently this only happens for property lookup, 
but in the future more expressions may be optimized). All local 
variables and parameters are allocated to Java VM registers. 
Function call targets are speculatively pre-cached (based on 
the name used in the source) so that dispatching can be direct, 
pending runtime confirmation of the actual target. Arguments are 
passed as Object/Number pairs to reduce conversion overhead.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Some language features (indirect calls to eval, use 
of the arguments property of function objects) were previously 
not supported in higher optimization levels. These features have 
been removed from the language in ECMA, so higher optimization 
levels are now conformant.</li>

  <li>Future versions may allocate more aggressive 
optimizations to higher optimization levels. For compatibility 
with future versions, use level 1. For maximal optimization, 
use level 9, but retest your application when upgrading to 
new versions.</li>
</ol>
