<h1>Rhino and BSF</h1>

<h2>What is BSF?</h2>

<p>The <a class="ex-ref" href="http://jakarta.apache.org/bsf/"><dfn>Bean
Scripting Framework (or BSF)</dfn></a> was originally developed by IBM 
and now published as open source as a project at the Apache Software 
Foundation. It provides a framework for using a number of scripting 
languages with Java. Rhino is one of the supported languages.</p>

<p>This framework has been embedded in a number of open source 
projects, including the XSL processor <a class="ex-ref" href="http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/">Xalan</a> and the XML/Java 
build tool <a class="ex-ref" href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a>.
See 
<a class="ex-ref" href="http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/extensions.html">Xalan-Java Extensions</a> for more information on adding JavaScript to XSL 
and the description of the optional Script task in the 
<a class="ex-ref" href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/">Apache Ant Manual</a> 
for using scripting in Ant build files.</p>

<h2 id="bsf-issue">Using BSF with Rhino</h2>

<p>Now that the Apache Jakarta <dfn>Bean Scripting Framework (BSF)</dfn>, 
version 2.4.0, has been officially released, you can use Rhino easily 
with BSF. See <a class="ex-ref" href="http://jakarta.apache.org/bsf/index.html">http://jakarta.apache.org/bsf/index.html</a>.
