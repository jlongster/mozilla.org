<h1 style="text-align: center;">Performance Hints</h1>

<h3><a name="varstatements" id="varstatements"><code>var</code> Statements</a></h3>

<p>Use <code>var</code> statements when possible. Not only is it good 
programming practice, it can speed up your code by allowing the compiler 
to generate special code to access the variables. For example, you could 
rewrite</p>

<pre class="code">
function sum(a) {
    result = 0;
    for (i=0; i &lt; a.length; i++)
        result += a[i];
    return result;
}
</pre>

<p>as</p>

<pre class="code">
function sum(a) {
    var result = 0;
    for (var i=0; i &lt; a.length; i++)
        result += a[i];
    return result;
}
</pre>

<p>This is not equivalent code because the second version does 
not modify global variables <code>result</code> and <code>i</code>. 
However, if you don't intend for any other function to access these 
variables, then storing them globally is probably wrong anyway 
(what if you called another function that had a loop like the one 
in <code>sum</code>!).</p>

<h3><a name="arrays" id="arrays">Arrays</a></h3>

<p>Use the forms of the Array constructor that specify a size or 
take a list of initial elements. For example, the code</p>

<pre class="code">
var a = new Array();
for (var i=0; i &lt; n; i++)
    a[i] = i;
</pre>

<p>could be sped up by changing the constructor call to 
<code>new Array(n)</code>. A constructor call like that indicates 
to the runtime that a Java array should be used for the first 
<var>n</var> entries of the array. Similarly,<br><br> 
<code>new Array(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;)</code><br>
or<br>
<code>[&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]</code><br><br>
will cause a 3-element Java array to be allocated to hold the 
contents of the JavaScript array.</p>

<h3><a name="eval" id="eval"><code>eval</code> and <code>new Function</code></a></h3>

<p>Avoid calling <code>eval</code> when possible. Calls to 
<code>eval</code> are slow because the script being executed must 
be compiled. Constructing a new function object can be slow for 
the same reason, while function expressions are more efficient 
because the function can be compiled. For example, the code</p>

<pre class="code">
function MyObject(a) {
    this.s = a;
    this.toString = new Function(&quot;return this.s&quot;);
}
</pre>

<p>could be written more efficiently as</p>

<pre class="code">
function MyObject(a) {
    this.s = a;
    this.toString = function () { return this.s }
}
</pre>

<p>Beginning with Rhino 1.4 Release 2, code passed to eval and 
new Function will be interpreted rather than compiled to class 
files.</p>

<h3><a name="with" id="with"><code>with</code></a></h3>

<p>Using the <code>with</code> statement prevents the compiler 
from generating code for fast access to local variables. You're 
probably better off explicitly accessing any properties of the 
object.</p>
