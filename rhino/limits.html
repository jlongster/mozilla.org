<h1 style="text-align: center;">Requirements and Limitations</h1>

<h2><a name="requirements" id="requirements">Requirements</a></h2>
<p>Rhino requires version 1.1 or greater of Java.</p>
<p>To use the JavaAdapter feature or an optimization level of 0 or greater,
Rhino must be running under a security manager that allows the definition
of class loaders.</p>

<h2><a name="limitations" id="limitations">Limitations</a></h2>

<h3><a name="platforms" id="platforms">Platforms and JITs</a></h3>
<p>Many platforms and JREs have problems converting decimal numbers to and
from strings. These errors are usually boundary case errors and will show
up as test failures in section 7.7.3.</p>
<p>Windows versions of the Symantec JIT prior to 3.00.029(i) will report
internal errors for some generated class files.</p>
<p>On the Symantec JIT and the AIX JVM, accessing a static field of a class
that has not yet loaded may not give the correct value of the field. For
example, accessing
<code class="filename">java.io.File.separatorChar</code> before <code class="filename">java.io.File</code>
has been loaded will return a value of 0. (This is a bug in the JIT; 
accessing the field should cause the class to be loaded.)</p>
<p>The AIX Java version "JDK 1.1.6 IBM build a116-19980924 (JIT enabled:
jitc)" core dumps running several classes generated by Rhino. It also has
errors in java.lang.Math.pow that are reflected as failures in the 
JavaScript Math object's pow method.</p>
<p>IBM Java for Linux version "JDK 1.1.8 IBM build l118-19991013 (JIT 
enabled: jitc)" has errors in java.lang.Math.pow that are reflected 
as test failures in the JavaScript Math object's pow method.</p>
<p>Solaris JDK 1.1.6 has errors in java.lang.Math.atan2 that are reflected
as test failures in the JavaScript Math object's atan2 method.</p>

<h3><a name="liveconnect" id="liveconnect">LiveConnect</a></h3>
<p>If a JavaObject's field's name collides with that of a method, the value
of that field is retrieved lazily, and can be counter-intuitively affected
by later assignments:</p>

<pre class="code">
javaObj.fieldAndMethod = 5;
var field = javaObj.fieldAndMethod;
javaObj.fieldAndMethod = 7;
<span class="remark">// now, field == 7</span>
</pre>

<p>You can work around this by forcing the field value to be converted to
a JavaScript type when you take its value:</p>

<pre class="code">
javaObj.fieldAndMethod = 5;
var field = javaObj.fieldAndMethod + 0; <span class="remark">// force conversion now</span>
javaObj.fieldAndMethod = 7;
<span class="remark">// now, field == 5</span>
</pre>

<h3><a name="jsobject" id="jsobject">JSObject</a></h3>
<p>Rhino does <strong>NOT</strong> support the 
<code class="filename">netscape.javascript.JSObject</code> class.</p>

<h3>Date object</h3>
<p>The JavaScript Date object depends on time facilities of the underlying
Java runtime to determine daylight savings time dates. Earlier JRE versions
may report a date for the daylight savings changeover that is a week off.
JRE 1.1.6 reports the correct date.</p>
<p>Under the 1.1.6 JRE, evaluating <code class="command">(new Date(1998, 9, 25, 2)).toString()</code>
returns:</p>
<pre class="code">        Sun Oct 25 02:00:00 GMT-0800 (PST) 1998
</pre>
<p>Earlier versions may return:</p>
<pre class="code">        Sun Oct 25 02:00:00 GMT-0700 (PDT) 1998
</pre>
<p>(the JRE doesn't report the changeover until Nov. 1.)</p>
<p>The Microsoft SDK 3.1 for Java also exhibits this problem.</p>
