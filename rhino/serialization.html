<h1 style="text-align: center;">Serialization</h1>

<script type="text/javascript">document.write(owner());</script>

<p>Beginning with Rhino 1.5 Release 3 it is possible to serialize 
JavaScript objects, including functions and scripts. However, 
serialization of code in compilation mode has some significant 
limitations. Serialization provides a way to save the state of 
an object and write it out to a file or send it across a 
network connection.</p>

<h2>Simple serialization example</h2>

<p>The Rhino shell has two new top-level functions, serialize 
and deserialize. They're intended mainly as examples of the 
use of serialization:</p>

<pre class="code">
$ java org.mozilla.javascript.tools.shell.Main
js&gt; function f() { return 3; }
js&gt; serialize(f, "f.ser")
js&gt; quit()

$ java org.mozilla.javascript.tools.shell.Main
js&gt; f = deserialize("f.ser")

function f() {
    return 3;
}

js&gt; f()
3
js&gt;
</pre>

<p>Here we see a simple case of a function being serialized to 
a file and then read into a new instance of Rhino and called.</p>

<h2>Rhino serialization APIs</h2>

<p>Two new classes, ScriptableOutputStream and ScriptableInputStream, 
were introduced to handle serialization of Rhino classes. These 
classes extend ObjectOutputStream and ObjectInputStream respectively. 
Writing an object to a file can be done in a few lines of Java code:</p>

<pre class="code">
FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(filename);
ScriptableOutputStream out = new ScriptableOutputStream(fos, scope);
out.writeObject(obj);
out.close();
</pre>

<p>Here filename is the file to write to, obj is the object or function 
to write, and scope is the top-level scope containing obj.</p>

<p>Reading the serialized object back into memory is similarly simple:</p>

<pre class="code">
FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(filename);
ObjectInputStream in = new ScriptableInputStream(fis, scope);
Object deserialized = in.readObject();
in.close();
</pre>

<p>Again, we need the scope to create our serialization stream class.</p>

<p>So why do we need these specialized stream classes instead of 
simply using ObjectOutputStream and ObjectInputStream? To understand 
the answer we must know what goes on behind the scenes when Rhino 
serializes objects.</p>

<h2>How Rhino serialization works</h2>

<p>By default, Java serialization of an object also serializes 
objects that are referred to by that object. Upon deserialization 
the initial object and the objects it refers to are all created and 
the references between the objects are resolved.</p>

<p>However, for JavaScript this creates a problem. JavaScript objects 
contain references to prototypes and to parent scopes. Default 
serialization would serialize the object or function we desired but 
would also serialize Object.prototype or even possibly the entire 
top-level scope and everything it refers to! We want to be able to 
serialize a JavaScript object and then deserialize it into a new 
scope and have all of the references from the deserialized object 
to prototypes and parent scopes resolved correctly to refer to 
objects in the new scope.</p>

<p>ScriptableOutputStream takes a scope as a parameter to its 
constructor. If in the process of serialization it encounters a 
reference to the scope it will serialize a marker that will be 
resolved to the new scope upon deserialization. It is also possible 
to add names of objects to a list in the ScriptableOutputStream 
object. These objects will also be saved as markers upon 
serialization and resolved in the new scope upon deserialization. 
Use the addExcludedName method of ScriptableOutputStream to add 
new names. By default, ScriptableOutputStream excludes all the names 
defined using Context.initStandardObjects.</p>

<p>If you are using Rhino serialization in an environment where 
you always define, say, a constructor "Foo", you should add the 
following code before calling writeObject:</p>

<pre class="code">
out.addExcludedName("Foo");
out.addExcludedName("Foo.prototype");
</pre>

<p>This code will prevent Foo and Foo.prototype from being 
serialized and will cause references to Foo or Foo.prototype to be 
resolved to the objects in the new scope upon deserialization. 
Exceptions will be thrown if Foo or Foo.prototype cannot be found 
the scopes used in either ScriptableOutputStream or 
ScriptableInputStream.</p>

<h2>Rhino serialization in compilation mode</h2>

<p>Serialization works well with objects and with functions and 
scripts in interpretive mode. However, you can run into problems 
with serialization of compiled functions and scripts:</p>

<pre class="code">
$&nbsp;cat test.js
function f() { return 3; }
serialize(f, "f.ser");
g = deserialize("f.ser");
print(g());
$ java org.mozilla.javascript.tools.shell.Main -opt -1 test.js
3
$ java org.mozilla.javascript.tools.shell.Main test.js
js: uncaught JavaScript exception: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: c1
</pre>

<p>The problem is that Java serialization has no built-in way to 
serialize Java classes themselves. (It might be possible to save 
the Java bytecodes in an array and then load the class upon 
deserialization, but at best that would eat up a lot of memory for 
just this feature.) One way around this is to compile the 
functions using the jsc tool:</p>

<pre class="code">
$ cat f.js
function f() { return 3; }
$ java -classpath js.jar org.mozilla.javascript.tools.jsc.Main f.js
$ cat test2.js
loadClass("f");
serialize(f, "f.ser");
g = deserialize("f.ser");
print(g());
$ java -classpath 'js.jar;.' org.mozilla.javascript.tools.shell.Main test2.js
3
</pre>

<p>Now the function f is compiled to a Java class, but that class 
is then made available in the classpath so serialization works. 
This isn't that interesting an example since compiling a function to 
a class and then loading it accomplishes the same as serializing an 
interpreted function, but it becomes more relevant if you wish to 
serialize JavaScript objects that have references to compiled 
functions.</p>
