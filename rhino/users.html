<h1 style="text-align: center;">How are people using Rhino?</h1>

<p>
Here's a partial list of the ways people are using Rhino in their projects.
The initial list was collected by Netscape marketing, so Rhino is referred
to as Netscape Java-based JavaScript. We'd love to hear how you're using
Rhino--just mail&nbsp;<script type="text/javascript">document.write(owner());</script>.
</p>

<p><a class="ex-ref" href="http://www.attachmate.com/">Attachmate</a>
<br>"Netscape JavaScript 1.5 with Java implementation was a perfect solution
for developing our MacroRecorder because it made our development process
faster and better, and our customers get a more efficient, reliable, and
standards based product as a result," said Rob Clark, Director of Product
Development at Attachmate. Attachmate integrates Netscape's Java-based
JavaScript 1.5 Interpreter into its 100% Pure Java certified web-to-host
thin clients, called e-Vantage Viewers. The Netscape Java-based JavaScript
interpreter is used in a MacroRecorder feature that allows browser-based
users to efficiently navigate host applications on mainframe and midrange
systems.</p>

<p><a class="ex-ref" href="http://www.avivasolutions.com/">Aviva Solutions</a>
<br>Aviva for Java is a mainframe connectivity product. To overcome 
the limitations of the arcane mainframe user interface, it is customary 
to provide scripting capabilities in such products, so that repetitive 
user actions can be automated. Aviva for Java is a Java applet. As such, 
its size, security and compatibility requirements are strict. Rhino has 
been found to be the perfect scripting engine: pure Java, works perfectly 
in an applet environment, regardless of the VM vendor or version, it 
is light and in the same time very powerful. JavaScript as the scripting 
language makes perfect sense in a browser environment.</p>

<p><a class="ex-ref" href="http://www.bristowhill.com/">Bristow Hill Software</a>
<br>"We thought it would require lots of work to add scripting capability
to Bristow Hill Server Pages, but we were delighted to find that Netscape
JavaScript 1.5 with Java implementation fit right in with only a couple
of lines of initialization code and one line of code to export our standard
objects by name. Also, we were pleased to find we could take embedded 
scripting and compile it down to Java classes which could be used directly 
for greater speed in production. Netscape's JavaScript engine is rock solid 
and standards compliant, and my only regret is that we didn't start using 
it sooner," said Don Anderson, President of Bristow Hill Software.</p>

<p><a class="ex-ref" href="http://www.celcorp.com/webrecorder.html">Celware WebRecorder</a>
<br>WebRecorder allows developers and analysts to quickly and easily 
automate Web navigation and data extraction from Web pages. Users can 
model and parameterize navigations and extractions, then wrap them in 
business processes for execution from a client application. Scripting 
via Rhino allows users to create the business logic in these processes. 
It also allows their processes to integrate Web access with any other 
kind of system or data the Java platform can reach.</p>

<p><a class="ex-ref" href="http://www.discoverymachine.com/">Discovery Machine</a>
<br>Discovery Machine's <dfn>Expertise Encoding and Execution Workshop (E3W)</dfn> 
allows experts to easily and seamlessly encode their knowledge and 
processes into immediately usable, executable graphical software that 
can then be shared, modified, and leveraged. In this environment, 
knowledge engineers can work with subject-matter experts as well as 
software engineers to develop models of expertise. At all points in the 
process, experts can understand and modify the models, even when models 
are fully operational. We were easily able to embed Rhino and immediately 
extend our language with Rhino's high-quality JavaScript interpreter.</p>

<p><a class="ex-ref" href="http://helma.org/">Helma Javascript Web Application Framework</a>
<br>Helma is an open source web application framework for fast and efficient 
scripting and serving of websites and Internet applications. Helma is written 
in Java and employs Rhino for its server-side scripting environment, removing 
the need for compilation cycles and reducing development costs while providing 
instant access to leverage the whole wealth of Java libraries out there. Helma 
offers simple and codeless mapping of application objects to database tables 
and an embedded object-oriented database performs automatic data persistence 
of unmapped objects. Helma has proven itself to be stable and fast, capable of 
serving high traffic sites with hundreds of thousands of dynamic pages per day.</p>

<p><a class="ex-ref" href="http://www.dojotoolkit.org/docs/shrinksafe">Dojo ShrinkSafe</a>
<br>Dojo uses Rhino's parse system to provide compression to JavaScript code, as opposite to other JavaScript objuscation compressor solutions using regular expression. </p>

<p><a href="http://httpunit.sourceforge.net/">HttpUnit</a>
<br>"Automated testing is a great way to ensure that code being maintained 
works. The <dfn>Extreme Programming (XP)</dfn> methodology relies heavily 
on it, and practitioners have available to them a range of testing 
frameworks, most of which work by making direct calls to the code being 
tested. But what if you want to test a web application? Or what if you 
simply want to use a web-site as part of a distributed application?</p>

<p>
In either case, you need to be able to bypass the browser and 
access your site from a program. HttpUnit makes this easy. Written in 
Java, HttpUnit emulates the relevant portions of browser behavior, 
including form submission, JavaScript, basic http authentication, 
cookies and automatic page redirection, and allows Java test code 
to examine returned pages either as text, an XML DOM, or containers 
of forms, tables, and links. When combined with a framework such as 
JUnit, it is fairly easy to write tests that very quickly verify the 
functioning of a web site."</p>

<p><a class="ex-ref" href="http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net/">HtmlUnit</a>
<br>HtmlUnit is a java unit testing framework for testing web 
based applications.</p>

<p><a class="ex-ref" href="http://www.icesoft.com/">ICEsoft Technologies</a>
<br>ICEsoft Technologies adds JavaScript support to their browser 
products using Rhino.</p>

<p><a class="ex-ref" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jscorba">JS/CORBA Adapter</a>
<br>The JS/CORBA Adapter provides a mechanism for arbitrary 
Javascript objects to interact with each other transparently in a 
distributed Javascript system using CORBA.</p>

<p><a class="ex-ref" href="http://www.lombardisoftware.com/">Lombardi Software</a>
<br>Lombardi Software's TeamWorks BPM platform uses Rhino for all 
embedded scripting.</p>

<p><a class="ex-ref" href="http://www.magoosoft.com/">Magoo Software</a>
<br>"We've just released version 1.5 of MagooClient, an XML messaging 
client, with Rhino inside. The availability of Rhino 1.6R1 with E4X marks 
a significant breakthrough in the way that people work with XML content. 
Instead of merely editing, users can add their own custom logic to 
perform calculations, implement validation rules that test relationships 
between elements and crucially, add callouts to external Web Services 
to populate XML documents. There have been several attempts at this 
type of rich XML client in the past but none offer the familiarity, 
simplicity and adherence to standards offered by Rhino/JavaScript/E4X." 
-- John McGuire, CTO Magoo Software.</p>

<p><a class="ex-ref" href="http://homepage.mac.com/pcbeard/JShell/">JShell</a>
<br>Rhino is used as the scripting language for the open source command
shell JShell written by Patrick Beard.</p>

<p><a class="ex-ref" href="http://www.runitsoft.no/">RUnit Software</a>
<br>RUnit Software uses Rhino as part of
solutions for business-process automation, for example
when the automation involves communicating with a
web-interface.</p>

<p><a class="ex-ref" href="http://www.seppia.org/">Seppia</a>
<br>"Seppia is a simple technology to build and deploy any Java application.
It gains from the synergy of Java and JavaScript and a minimum set of clear 
rules to organize their interaction. Seppia allows developers to create 
stand-alone applications from constituent parts. Each part is a module: 
a unit of function integrating seamlessly JavaScript files, jar files and 
other resources. Seppia uses Mozilla Rhino to empower its JavaScript 
engine. Seppia will challenge the way you think of Java-based component 
computing."</p>

<p><a class="ex-ref" href="http://www.tdiinc.com/">Technology Deployment International</a>
<br>"Technology Deployment International selected the Java-based Netscape
JavaScript engine to incorporate into the workflow module of our eBusiness
Management System (eBMS) allowing our customers to integrate business logic
into any workstep of their application," said Dr. Kelvin Liu, VP eBMS Development,
Technology Deployment International. "It has been easy to embed, the support
we received from the engineering team has been outstanding, and the performance
of the JavaScript code is almost identical to the equivalent Java."</p>

<p><a class="ex-ref" href="http://www.xmoon.org/">XMoon</a>
<br>XMoon is a dynamic OO (Object Oriented) opensource extension released 
under LGPL License for Jakarta Struts, powerful and easy to use.
XMoon lets you develop business logic classes following a fully Java 
compatible scripting language allowing execution of Java code at runtime 
without any access to a compiler.</p>
