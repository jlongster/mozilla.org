<h1>
What's New in Rhino 1.5 Release 2</h1></center>
This is a log of significant changes since the release of Rhino 1.5 Release
1.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Graphical debugger</h2>
Thanks to a contribution by Christopher Oliver, Rhino now has a graphical
debugger. See <a href="debugger.html">Rhino Debugger</a> for more details.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Footprint reductions</h2>
Igor Bukanov has provided a wealth of changes to reduce the number and
size of objects required by Rhino. In particular, he introduced a new way
to represent the built-in objects like Date and RegExp that reduces the
amount of memory required and speeds up <tt>Context.initStandardObjects</tt>.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Interpreted mode performance improvements</h2>
Igor Bukanov also made a number of improvements to interpreter mode performance.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
JS/CORBA Adapter</h2>
Matthias Radestock wrote a module that allows JavaScript code to interact
with CORBA. See <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jscorba">http://sourceforge.net/projects/jscorba</a>
for more details.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Directory restructuring and Ant buildfile</h2>
I've restructured the the Rhino directory and written an <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/index.html">Ant</a>
buildfile. This should make building easier and more consistent with other
open source Java projects.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
FlattenedObject deprecated</h2>
I wrote FlattenedObject to provide a means for dealing with JavaScript
<br>objects in prototype chains. Where Scriptable defines the primitive
<br>operations, FlattenedObject defines the aggregate operations of
<br>manipulating properties that may be defined in an object or in an object
<br>reachable by a succession of getPrototype calls.
<p>However, I now believe that I designed FlattenedObject poorly. Perhaps
<br>it should have been a clue that I was never satisfied with the name:
if
<br>it's hard to express the name of the object it may mean the function
the
<br>object is supposed to fulfill is not well defined either. The problem
is
<br>that it is inefficient since it requires an extra object creation,
and
<br>balky because of that extra level of wrapping.
<p>So I've checked in changes that deprecate FlattenedObject. I've
<br>introduced new static methods in ScriptableObject (thanks to
<br>beard@netscape.com for the idea) that replace the functionality. These
<br>methods perform the get, put, and delete operations on a Scriptable
<br>object passed in without the overhead of creating a new object.
<h2>
WrapHandler interface</h2>
Embeddings that wish to provide their own custom wrappings for Java objects
may implement this interface and
<br>call Context.setWrapHandler. See WrapHandler javadoc.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
ClassOutput interface</h2>
An interface embedders can implement in order to control the placement
of generated class bytecodes. See the javadoc.
