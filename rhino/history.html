<h1>Rhino History</h1>

<p>Rhino gets its name from the animal on the cover of the <a href="http://www.ora.com/">O'Reilly</a>

book about JavaScript.</p>

<p>The Rhino project was started at Netscape in Fall 1997. At the time,
Netscape was planning to produce a version of Navigator written
entirely in Java and so it needed an implementation of JavaScript
written in Java. When Netscape stopped work on "Javagator", as it was
called, somehow Rhino escaped the axe (rumor had it that the executives
"forgot" it existed). Since then, a couple of major companies
(including Sun) have licensed Rhino for use in their products and
paid Netscape to do so, allowing us to continue work on it. Now Rhino
is planned to be part of several server products from Netscape as well.</p>

<p>Originally, Rhino compiled all JavaScript code to Java bytecodes in
generated classfiles. This produced the best performance (often beating
the C implementation of JavaScript when run on a JIT), but suffered
from two faults. First, compilation time was long since generating Java
bytecodes and loading the generated classes was a heavyweight process.
Also, the implementation effectively leaked memory since most JVMs don't
really collect unused classes or the strings that are interned as a
result of loading a class file.</p>

<p>So in Fall of 1998, Rhino added an interpretive mode. The classfile
generation code was moved to an optional, dynamically-loaded package.
Compilation is faster and when scripts are no longer in use they can
be collected like any other Java object.</p>

<p>Rhino was released to mozilla.org in April of 1998. Originally Rhino
classfile generation had been held back from release. However the
licensees of Rhino have now agreed to release all of Rhino to open
source, including class file generation. Since its release to open
source, Rhino has found a variety of <a href="users.html">uses</a>
and an increasing number of people have contributed to the code.</p>
