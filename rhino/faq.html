<dt>How do I create a Java array from JavaScript?</dt>
<dd>You must use Java reflection. For instance, to create an array 
of java.lang.String of length five, do
<pre class="code">
var stringArray = java.lang.reflect.Array.newInstance(java.lang.String, 5);
</pre>
<p>Then if you wish to assign the string "hi" to the first element, simply
execute <var>stringArray[0] = "hi"</var>.</p>
<p>Creating arrays of primitive types is slightly different: you must use
the TYPE field. For example, creating an array of seven ints can be done
with the code</p>
<pre class="code">
var intArray = java.lang.reflect.Array.newInstance(java.lang.Integer.TYPE, 7);
</pre><br><br></dd>

<dt>When I try to execute a script I get the exception <code>Required security context missing</code>. What's going on?</dt>
<dd>You've likely missed placing the 
<code class="filename">Security.properties</code> file in your class path at 
<code class="filename">org.mozilla.javascript.resources</code>.</dd>
