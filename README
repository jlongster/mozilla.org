Mozilla.org
===========


Description
-----------
This is the main mozilla.org site, supporting many languages.


Requirements
------------
 1. Make sure name-based virtual hosting is enabled. In Apache, check for this
    line in httpd.conf:

    NameVirtualHost *:80

 1. DNS entries for any languages you will be supporting. (For testing,
    pointing *.name.com -> name.com will work well).


Installation
--------------

 1. (Assuming Apache) create a virtual host for your site that supports all DNS
    entries you made.  Also be sure to add the Rewrite rules below.
    Example:

        <VirtualHost *:80>
            ServerName www.mozilla.com
            ServerAlias *.www.mozilla.com
            DocumentRoot /data/www.mozilla.com
            AddType application/x-httpd-php .php .html
            DirectoryIndex index.php index.html
            Options -Indexes

            RewriteEngine On
            RewriteMap toupper int:toupper
        </VirtualHost>

    Notice that we're parsing html as php - this is for backwards compatibility
    with the stuff we migrated from mozilla-europe.

 2. Check out the code from svn.mozilla.org/projects/mozilla.org/trunk/ to your
    webroot.

 3. Copy /includes/config.inc.php-dist to /includes/config.inc.php, and fill
    out all variables.
