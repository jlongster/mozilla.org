<h2>News</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    It seems that the development on the "Mozilla Classic" GTK+
    frontend has halted.  Development efforts are now turning to
    the <a href="../../newlayout/">new layout engine</a> and
    <a href="../../xpfe/">cross platform front end code</a>,
    together code named <strong>Seamonkey</strong>.
  <li>
    The X heads at Netscape decided that now would be the best time
    to move away from Motif.  They choose GTK+ as the target toolkit
    for development under the X Windows System.
  <li>
    The platform independant code for Seamonkey has been implemented
    in GTK+.  This is currently the code that gets used in the
    default build of Seamonkey under Unix.
</ul>

<h2>Development</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Building Seamonkey under GTK+ is fairly simple.  The first place to
    look is the <a href="../../projects/autoconf">autoconf project
    page</a>.  This will give you a lot of information on the build
    system for Mozilla.  There are complete instructions on building
    under Unix
    <a href="../../build/unix.html">
    here</a>.
  <li>
    Everyone loves screenshots. MozillaZine has been tracking the
    progress of GTK+ Seamonkey.  You can find screenshots
    <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/screenshots/">here</a>.
  <li>
    Please help us! The work to implement all the widgets is not done
    yet. For more information on what needs to be done, post to
    <a href="news://news.mozilla.org/netscape.public.mozilla.gtk">netscape.public.mozilla.gtk</a>
