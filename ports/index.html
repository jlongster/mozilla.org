<p>Many different groups are planning ports of Mozilla to new platforms and
toolkits. This page contains a list of all known-active ports of
Mozilla, as well as how to find out more about them. The
<a href="http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/showbuilds.cgi?tree=SeaMonkey-Ports">
Tinderbox Ports</a> page lets you check the build status for various platforms.
If you set up an automated build machine for your port we can add it to the 
tinderbox page.

<p>As with other Mozilla-derived projects, if you are organizing a serious
porting effort of some kind, and would like us to host the web pages and
<a href="../community.html">mailing lists</a> about that project here on
mozilla.org, <a href="../feedback.html">let's talk</a>.

<p>Pages for the following porting efforts are currently hosted here.
Note that these pages are maintained by others, not by the staff of mozilla.org.

<ul>
 <li><a href="qtmozilla/">QtMozilla</a>, maintaining the TrollTech Qt Toolkit port.
 <li><a href="fizzilla/">Fizzilla</a>, a port to Mac OS X using Carbon instead of Cocoa (Yellow Box).
 <li><a href="os2/">OS/2</a>,
  a port to IBM's OS/2 and Serenity's eComStation operating systems.
