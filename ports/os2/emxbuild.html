<H1>Build Instructions for Warpzilla with EMX/GCC/PGCC</H1>
<H2>Step 1: Setup your environment</H2>
<P>
SETMOZENV.CMD uses environment variables to locate the various tools that are needed for the build. The following
environment variables should be set to point to where your tools are located:
<PRE>
GLIB
LIBIDL
AUTOCONF
EMX
MOZTOOLS
</PRE>
Note that if you have all of your tools directory of off your root directory, you do not need to set these values.
When you have set up the variables, type:
<PRE>
SETMOZENV
</PRE>
<H2>Step 2: Get the Code</H2>
To get the code from CVS, go the directory where you want to put Warpzilla and type:
<PRE>
cvs checkout mozilla/client.mk
</PRE>
Then type:
<PRE>
cd mozilla
gmake -f client.mk pull_all
</PRE>
<H2>Step 3: Build the code</H2>
Go to the mozilla directory and type:
<PRE>
gmake -f client.mk build_all
</PRE>
The build itself is actually two steps, an export step that builds required tools and copies headers into the dist, and a
libs step that actually builds the code. If you encounter a situation where the export step appears to complete,
but the libs step does not begin, you can type
<PRE>
gmake libs
</PRE>
to continue the build. We are investigating why this is happening. It involves a 255 error return code from gmake.
<H2>Step 4: Run the code</H2>
<P>The executable is located in mozilla/dist/bin. Type:
<PRE>
mozilla
</PRE>
to run it.
