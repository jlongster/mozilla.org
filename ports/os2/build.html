<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>compiling the sources</h1>
<P>
If you have installed everything properly and downloaded the current
source tree either using the cvs server at cvs.mozilla.org or in 
tarball form and applied the patches, you can begin to compile the sources.

<p> Now you must also have some command file that sets up the environment 
variables and adjusts the PATH and BEGINLIBPATH (for example, it 
may look like this: <a href="warpzilla.cmd">warpzilla.cmd</a>). 

<p>
You can either use emx/gcc or VisualAge for C++. An environment
setting in your setup script <b>warpzilla.cmd</b> will determine which
compiler the make utility uses.

<p>
The most upto date build instructions known are way over on the East 
coast of America: <a href="ftp://joyce.eng.yale.edu/pub/warpzilla/os2build.html">
Joan Touzet's page</a>.

You may also look on John Fairhurst's <a href="http://yuggoth.ucam.org/~mjf35/warpzilla/nglayout/">NGLayout web page</a>.
<P>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>autoconf build</h2>
<p>
The main mozilla source tree has moved to an autoconf build system and 
has gotten rid of all makefiles (except maybe in nsprpub) so the 
system is in continuing flux these days and may even require some 
additional tools; <a href="mailto:sobotka@axess.com">Henry</a> would 
be pleased to receive help moving the conversion along.
