<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>checking out the source</H1>
<P> There are two main ways for obtaining warpzilla source. Method #1 
would be to retrieve directly from the mozilla.org cvs server the code 
required. Sadly, our group has not been able to commit all of the
most recent changes to the os/2 source. Method #2 requires to obtain 
a tarball from some graciously provided ftp server.

<P> Here are the explanations with how to go about it. For now, the ideal path
will be the two methods somewhat cobbled together.

<P><br>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>cvs access</H2>
<p>
Using your <a href="setup.html">previously acquired and installed</a> cvs tool 
and a bit of ingeniuity, you too can get the semi-latest version of the 
Warpzilla sources: check out the instructions on the <a href="../../cvs.html">source 
code via cvs page</a>.
<P>
Achim has written a nice little script to do those steps for you <a href="checkout.cmd">
<b>checkout.cmd</b></a> just call <b>checkout.cmd</b> from X:\Warpzilla. 

<P> This is a really nice little system and would be a great solution but this 
is the code for the mozilla classic front-end and things have been evolving 
at a frenetic pace: we are now mostly working on the source for nglayout 
and the xpfe.

<P> Our <strong>nspr</strong> modifications have been checked in to the tip of the 
tree this week (November 19th) so at least that module (nsprpub) should 
compile straight out of the box. <br>
Try: 
<pre>cvs -z3 co NSPR</pre> 
to retrieve that library,
<P>
<pre>cvs -z3 co SeaMonkeyBrowser</pre> 
should get you all of the other files necessary to build the browser that are
already in the cvs (without most of the OS/2 modifications yet).

<P> 

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>tarballs</H2>
<p> We will try to supply soon a tarball of the most recent source
modifications that were made but the primary aim is to get the changes 
into the main mozilla <tt>cvs</tt>.
<P> 
A slightly convoluted directory shuffling technique was described 
on <a href="http://yuggoth.ucam.org/~mjf35/warpzilla/nglayout/">John 
Fairhurst's page</a> but no longer seems to be available.

<P>
Joan Touzet's page of 
<a href="ftp://joyce.eng.yale.edu/pub/warpzilla/os2build.html">build 
instructions</a> is quite complete and offers access to a recent source
<a href="ftp://joyce.eng.yale.edu/pub/warpzilla/nglwarpzilla-src-1.0.2.zip"> 
zipball</a>.

<P>
So that sounds like the better solution for now.


<P> Now, off to <A HREF="build.html">compilation</A>...
