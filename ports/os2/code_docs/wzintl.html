<p>
There are several areas where Warpzilla needs to worry about i18n.  At time
of writing, the implementations are cursory.  OS/2 has very good locale and
conversion support, however the function is not used by the C libraries
supplied with either EMX or VAC++.  So:
<br>

files.

<p>
<strong>Locale</strong>
<p>
Code currently in /mozilla/intl/locale/src/os2.
<br>
This does collation and correctly formatted dates and times, which make
use of the country and user properties.
<br>
<img src="hamm.gif">Needs to be rewritten to be correct and use the Uni* API.
<p>
There's also an opportunity here to write an interface to translate between
platform and XP locale IDs; it's not clear why we need to do this.
<br>

<p>
<strong>Default encodings</strong>
<p>
There needs to be code in /mozilla/intl/uconv/src/ which determines the
default encoding.  Essentially this needs to translate between OS/2 codepages
and encoding names (eg. "ISO-8859-1").  At the moment we use the unix code.
<br>
<img src="hamm.gif">Write this.

<p>
<strong>Input</strong>
<p>
Need to support input of mbcs characters, mapping <strong>WM_CHAR</strong>
events to unicode characters.  This is straightforward through the Uni* APi.
<br>
<img src="hamm.gif">Write this.
<br>
<img src="hamm.gif">Investigate MBCS and BiDi input.

<p>
<strong>Output</strong>
<p>
Need to support drawing Unicode strings.  Both Mozilla and OS/2 provide
converters from Unicode to another encoding which we can draw.  Not yet
clear how to pick the correct encoding; will need to know at the time of
creating fonts in order to get the codepage right.  
<br>
<img src="hamm.gif">Investigate and write this.

<p>
There's lots to do here, and much to be gained by talking with the Mozilla
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/">i18n group</a>.
