<p>
XPConnect is the mechanism whereby XPCOM classes written in C++ can be
accessed from javascript, and vice-versa.  See
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/scriptable/">XPConnect pages</a>.
<p>
On the platform-specific front, there needs to be code to call the nth
virtual method of a given pointer-to-object with an arbitrary-ish list
of parameters, and code to call into javascript from an object with
stubbed out methods.  This requires assembler.
<p>
The OS/2 code is in /mozilla/xpcom/libxpt/xptcall/src/md/os2 ; the emx
code is written.  Not yet checked in to mozilla.org CVS.
<p>
<img src="hamm.gif">VACPP uses the _Optlink calling convention with C++
methods, which means that certain parameters are passed in registers.
For a functional VACPP Mozilla, this needs to be written.

<p>
To watch: XPConnect is not long long clean; the owner knows about the
problem and may even fix it.
