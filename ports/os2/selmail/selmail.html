<H3>What is selectable mail?</H3>

<P>Modern browsers provide three common ways to access email: 
<UL>
<LI>Mailto URL's, these are broadly supported and  defined in RFC-2368
<LI>New Message, Send Link and Send Page commands (menu items and 
toolbar buttons), these allow users to create a new mail message with 
the content specified..
<LI>Read mail commands, these open the mail client to its default view.
</UL>
<P>Traditionally these have been handled by a built in mail client. 
Netscape Navigator 4.04 did allow users to use another mail client but 
required the user to edit the pref.js. Also the mail client was 
required to implement their <I>Third-Party Mail and News API</I>. This 
design will allow runtime selection of any mail clients and utilize 
existing mail client API's. Selection of a mail client will be done via 
a preference  panel which presents a list of all available mail 
clients. On a Windows system, to be included in this list a mail client 
program must have set the appropriate keys in the Windows system 
registry, support MAPI, and provide a command to open to its default 
view. If the mail client does not support mailto protocol handling we 
will use the most recently selected client which does provide support. 
<P>This design describes how the current mail command handlers will be 
changed to access the &quot;selected&quot; mail client, how user's will 
select the desired mail program,  how existing clients will be 
discovered and used on Windows, and how mail clients on other platforms 
may be made available to Mozilla.
<H3>Overview</H3>
<P>The primary functional objective for this component is to provide a 
cross platform selectable mail framework. A secondary consideration is 
to make the framework easily extensible to other applications (news, 
calendar, address book, etc.) 
<P>As noted in the introduction there are three well known ways that 
users access mail from browsers. Our framework will define interfaces 
for those access methods and provide a means for the discovery of 
available mail programs which support those access methods. Since many 
mail clients are already supported on Windows this framework must be 
compatible with those clients. Also it should be easily extended to 
support existing frameworks on other platforms. 
<P>We will create XPCOM interfaces for each of the mail access methods. 
Further we will define an interface which allows the listing of 
available mail clients and the selection of one of those clients. Thus 
an implementer of these interfaces may support multiple mail programs.
<P>After some discussion in the XPCOM newsgroup it appear that the 
preferred way to handle selection is the use of component categories. 
As Don Box describes in &quot;Essential COM&quot;,
<UL>
<LI>&quot;Although it makes little sense to ask for &quot;any available 
implementation&quot; of a given interface, it sometimes does make sense 
to have semantic groupings of implementations, all of which share 
certain high-level traits, such as being an animal or providing a 
logging service. To support this type of component discovery, COM 
supports advertising such taxonomies through the use of <I>component 
categories.</I>&quot;
</UL>
<P>We will define a category for each interface and define a default 
key for each. All browser mail access command handlers will be 
rewritten to request the &quot;default&quot; implementation from 
category manager. The user may change the &quot;default&quot; during 
runtime using a preference panel. 
<H2>Design Overview</H2>
<H3>Data Structure</H3>
<P>The main data structure utilized by this component is the Mozilla 
component registry. This provides the mapping of interface to 
implementation within the XPCOM framework. According to <I>XPCOM 
Dynamic Component Registration</I> written by Suresh Duddi, XPCOM 
defines three types of component registries:
<OL>
<LI><B>App-Component-Registry</B> - Each application has its own 
component registry that lives along with the app in its 
&lt;exe-dir&gt;/components directory. The component registry is created 
on installation or first run. It is used read-only by XPCOM.
<LI><B>User-Component-Registry </B>- Each user can install additional 
components under their user directory. These components will be shared 
across all XPCOM applications that the user runs.
<LI><B>Meta-Component-Registry</B> - Sharing components between 
applications can happen in two ways. The installer of an application 
can find the other application's components by looking for the 
application specifically and registering them with this app's component 
registry. The second and more preferable approach is to keep a machine 
wide Meta-Components-Registry that would aggregate all the app 
component registries.
</OL>
<P>The different component registries will be searched in the following 
order:
<OL>
<LI>User Component Registry
<LI>App Component Registry
<LI>Meta Component Registry
</OL>
<P>The user component registry is the only one that will be updated on 
the fly by XPCOM. This will be used to store the user selection. 
Unfortunately, user component registries have not yet been implemented. 
If this work is not complete prior to implementing this design, the 
user prefs file may be used to store selections and setup the App 
component registry during browser startup.
<H3>Flows</H3>
<P>This section describes the normal process of mail client selection 
and runtime access to the selected client. The description assumes a 
Win32 system but then describes how this can be extended to other 
platforms.
<H4>Mail Client Access Methods</H4>
<P><B></B>The browser defines several GUI elements which open the mail 
client to a specific view or using the current web page. Currently, 
there are two distinct ways that the current command handlers access 
the mail/news client. The following JavaScript functions are for the 
File-&gt;Send Link menu item and the File-&gt;New-&gt;Message menu item 
respectively.
<PRE>
function BrowserSendLink(pageUrl, pageTitle)
{
     window.openDialog( "chrome://messengercompose/content/", "_blank",
                        "chrome,all,dialog=no",
                        "body='" + pageUrl + "',subject='" + pageTitle + "',bodyislink=true");
}

function goOpenNewMessage()
{
     var msgComposeService = Components.classes["component://netscape/messengercompose"].getService(); 
     msgComposeService = msgComposeService.QueryInterface(Components.interfaces.nsIMsgComposeService); 
     msgComposeService.OpenComposeWindow( null,
                                          null,
                                          Components.interfaces.nsIMsgCompType.New,
                                          Components.interfaces.nsIMsgCompFormat.Default,
                                          null); 
}
</PRE>
<P>BrowserSendLink() opens a dialog by type which implicitly assumes 
that a new Mozilla dialog is needed and that the mail/news client will 
use that dialog. The second is closer to the approach we will use, 
goOpenNewMessage() requests a service by ProgID 
"component://netscape/messengercompose". Then it gets the 
nsIMsgComposeService interface on that component to call 
OpenComposeWindow with the desired parameters. 
<P>Instead of using a set ProgID, the currently selected mail client 
will be requested from the category manager. The semantics of using 
category manager are to simply supply the desired category and a string 
key. The return is another string which represents a ProgID. For the 
call above we will request the "default" key value from the 
MailClientCompose category. 
<H4>Mail Client Discovery and Selection</H4>
<P>If the Mozilla mail/news client is installed then it will be defined 
as the default implementation of each mail access interface. When the 
user opens the "Internet Applications" preference pane, the mail 
program list will be populated using each registered implementation of 
nsIMailClientService. This essentially defines two functions, the first 
returns a list of mail client names and the second sets the current 
mail client using a name from the previous return list. Implementations 
of nsIMailClientService must be in the form a DLL implementing 
NSRegisterSelf() which is placed in the &lt;exe-dir&gt;/components 
directory. This allows the implementation to be detected by the browser 
during autodetection.
<P>This structure allows us to create an implementation of 
nsIMailClientService which can support existing platform API's. On 
Windows the implementation would read the mail client system registry 
values to list mail client programs. If the user selects one of the 
programs it found in the system registry, it will then retrieve the 
values for  each of the mail access commands.  The preference panel 
code will be responsible for verifying that each mail interface is 
supported by the selected client, this can be done either by providing 
query functions in the nsIMailClientService interface or accessing each 
mail access interface after setting a new client.
<P>The implementation of nsIMailClientService and the mail access 
interfaces can be extended to utilize exiting API's on other platforms 
by enclosing all platform specific code within #ifdef &lt;platform&gt; 
blocks. Alternately, mail client developers could create their own  
implementation of these interfaces. As long as the DLL is placed in the 
components directory and exports NSRegisterSelf(), the mail client will 
appear in the list of selectable programs.
<H2>Externals</H2>
<H3>Graphical and Full Screen User Interfaces</H3>
<P>Mozilla will allow user customizations through a Preferences pane 
shown below. On a Win32 system the list is populated from the windows 
registry, specifically the default value of each subkey below 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Clients\Mail. Also the list will include 
Mozilla's mail client "Messenger" if installed. The selected mail 
client is applied as soon as the user selects Apply or OK (no restart 
of the browser is required). 
<P>The selected program is then used for all mail access commands.  
Mozilla currently supplies the following UI elements to access mail 
functionality.

<P>The following image shows our proposed changes and additions to the 
Mozilla preferences dialog. This shows the Preferences dialog with the 
"Mail and news" category renamed to Composer, since the setting are 
specific to that mail client.  Also shown is the addition of an 
"Internet Applications" category. 
<P><IMG SRC="selmail1.jpg">
<P>This could be extended to include other application categories as 
shown here
<P><IMG SRC="selmail2.jpg">
<H4>Error Dialogs</H4>
<P>We will also need an error dialog to display if the user selects a 
mail client which does not support mailto. This dialog will  allow the 
user to choose whether another program should be used for this 
function. The dialog  will also allow the user to choose not to have 
the message displayed in future attempts to use mailto URLs.
<H2>APIs</H2>
<P>This project is defining a new API within Mozilla. This API allows 
us to create implementations which utilize existing platform API's such 
as the Win32 Mail Client API. It can also be easily extended to utilize 
other API's.
<H3>Win32 Mail Program API</H3>
<P>The API identifies three distinct ways of accessing mail client 
functionality. These correspond to the three user activities:
<UL>
<LI>Accessing a mailto URL
<LI>Creating a new message (blank or containing the current page/link)
<LI>Viewing received mail
</UL>
<P>In order to support all three types of access the client program 
must define the following registry keys:
<P>(HKLM = HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE)
<P>
<P>
<P>
<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR>
<TD WIDTH=50%><B>Key</B></TD>
<TD WIDTH=50%><B>Value</B></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD WIDTH=50%><B>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Clients\Mail</B>
</UL>
Specifies the name of the subkey where information about the default mail client can be found. The root key of the information for this client can be found by appending this string to 
HKLM\Software\Clients\Mail</TD>
<TD WIDTH=50%>(default)</TD></TR>
<TR>

enumerating all the client subkeys and appending the friendly name for 
each to the list.</TD>
<TD WIDTH=50%>(default)</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD WIDTH=50%><B>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Clients\Mail\<I>clientname</I></B>
<P>Contains the path to the .dll or .exe file to be used for simple 
MAPI calls. If this key is present and the mail client is the default, 
this .dll/.exe will be used. If the key is not present, the .dll/.exe 
associated with the CMCDLLName32 name/value pair in the [Mail] section 
of the Win.ini file will be used. If the Win.ini entry is not present, 
Mapi32.dll will be used.</TD>
<TD>DLLPath</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD WIDTH=50%><B>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Clients\Mail\<I>clientname</I>
\Protocols\mailto</B>
<P>Contains a mirror of the registry settings that the application 
needs to have written under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\mailto to service URLs 
that use the mailto protocol.
This entire registry hierarchy replaces the existing mailto: registry 
hierarchy.</TD>
<TD>(various)</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD WIDTH=50%><B>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Clients\Mail\<I>clientname</I>
\shell\open\command</B>
<P>Contains the command line that will launch the mail client into its 
default view (typically the Inbox).</TD>
<TD WIDTH=50%>(default)</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>By separating these into distinct command paths we are able to use 
mail clients which do not support all three. For example if the user 
selects a mail client that does not support mailto URL's or MAPI calls 
(for new message creation), they could still access their inbox from 
the user interface. The calls which are not supported by the selected 
mail client are handled by the default mail client.
<H4>Mozilla mail API</H4>
<P>To provide the same functionality in Mozilla we will define the 
following four XPCOM interfaces:
<UL>
<LI>nsIMailClientCompose - provides functions to create a new mail 
message 
<LI>nsIMailClientInbox - provides a function to open the mail client to 
its default view
<LI>nsIMailClientMailtoHandler - provides a function which takes a 
mailto URL and opens a new message using the information in the URL 
<LI>nsIMailClientService -  provides a listing of mail clients by user 
readable name and the ability to set one of the named clients as 
"selected".
</UL>
<P>The first three are simple wrappers for the commands currently found 
in the Windows registry.  The third  essentially provides a platform 
independent way to list available clients. We will provide a Windows 
implementation of these interfaces which uses the existing Windows 
system registry values.  This implementation will also serve as an 
example for implementation of a similar scheme on other platforms. 
<H4>Mail API Categories</H4>
<P>To allow selection from multiple  implementations of the previous 
mail client interfaces we use the concept of component categories. Each 
interface has a corresponding category as follows:
<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR>
<TD>
<UL><B>Interface</B></TD>
<TD><B>Category</B></TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>nsIMailClientService</TD>
<TD>mailClient</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>nsIMailClientCompose</TD>
<TD>mailClient/compose</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>nsIMailClientInbox</TD>
<TD>mailClient/inbox</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>nsIMailtoHandler</TD>
<TD>mailClient/mailto</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>The "mailClient" category will be used to enumerate all available 
implementations. The other three categories will be used to select an 
implementation and access the current implementation. Each of these 
mailClient/xxx categories will contain an entry called "default". 
Selection is accomplished by setting the value of this entry to the 
ProgID of the desired implementation.
