<h2>More Information</h2>

<p>This grant went toward software development, infrastructure, and communications. The Free Software Foundation ported coreboot to the alix.2c3 board, a board useful in building routers, firewalls, and wifi access points. Developers committed 123 patches to the coreboot free BIOS project for a total of over 1300 lines of code. The FSF was able to upgrade its office workstations to coreboot and shared information about this process publicly for others to benefit at the coreboot summit in Denver. Using this grant, the FSF continued public advocacy for free bios and private discussions with vendors about plans for them to sell coreboot desktop systems to the public.</p>
