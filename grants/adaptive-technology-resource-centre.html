<p>Email is a critical tool in the workplace and arguably more so for users who
are blind. These users typically have to resort to paying for expensive,
proprietary email software. Thunderbird should be considered an exemplar of
email accessibility and FLOSS choice for users of assistive technology. This
grant enabled the development of an accessible Thunderbird user interface as
well as its adoption through evangelism,  mentoring, community-building, and
technical leadership, with a particular focus on working with the jQuery
community to implement ARIA support in this popular toolkit.</p>

<h2>More Information</h2>

<p>This implementation constituted the first fully accessible free e-mail
application. With the development of this technology, Thunderbird benefitted
more completely from the accessibility of XUL and HTML. The coding effort
attempted to address chrome and core bugs in the keyboard navigation and
semantics.</p>

<p>This grant enabled resolution of some important accessibility issues in
Thunderbird. Roughly 10 bugs have been fixed or had fixes nearing completion as
part of this grant. The grant also enabled participation in the solving of
accessibility issues as part of a greater team; including numerous patch
reviews, triage discussions over IRC, as well as the reporting of new bugs.</p>
