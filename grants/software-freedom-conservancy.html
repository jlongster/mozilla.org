<h2>More Information</h2>

<p>The Mozilla Foundation provided a $10,000 grant to the Software Freedom
Conservancy in 2008. During the grant period, Mozilla's funding helped the
Conservancy to provide administrative, financial management, coordination and
logistical services to twenty FLOSS (Free, Libre, and Open Source Software)
projects including Foresight Linux, Sugar Labs, jQuery, Amarok, Darcs,
OpenInkpot, and K-3D. The Conservancy began an effort to organize the
development of financial management software for use by itself and other
nonprofit organizations associated with FLOSS.</p>

<h2>Software Freedom Conservancy</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://conservancy.softwarefreedom.org/">Software Freedom
Conservancy</a> is a sister organization to the <a
href="http://www.softwarefreedom.org/">Software Freedom Law Center</a>. The two
organizations share staff and offices but are independent entities. Both SFLC
and SFC offer services to all free software and open source projects.</p>

<p>Please consider <a href="/foundation/donate.html">making a contribution</a>
to the Mozilla Foundation so we can continue to make grants to other worthwhile
organizations such as the Software Freedom Conservancy.</p>
