<p>Since 2009 Mozilla has supported the graduate-level work of PhD students at
Northeastern University, developing new tools for the standardization,
streamlining, and testing of JavaScript. In 2009 we contributed $99,115 to the
research efforts of <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/samth/">Sam
Tobin-Hochstadt</a>. In 2010 Mozilla made two gifts: one of $107,596 to further
support Mr. Tobin-Hochstadt's research and another gift of $76,374 to <a
href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/dimvar/info.html">Demetrios
Vardoulakis</a>.</p>

<h2>More Information</h2>

<p>Sam Tobin-Hochstadt's research under Professor Mitchell Wand has primarily
focused on the next revision of the JavaScript programming language, including
enabling programmers to evolve existing JavaScript code to use new language
features such as modules. Dimitros Vardoulakis, working under the direction of
Olin Shivers, has focused on CFA2, a new flow analysis for functional
languages. CFA2 is the first flow analysis with unbounded call/return matching
in the presence of higher-order functions and tail calls. As a summer intern at
Mozilla, Mr. Vardoulakis implemented CFA2 for JavaScript and <a
href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/dimvar/jstypes.html">used it for type
inference</a>. Mozilla used the analysis in Doctor JS, a web service that
analyzes JavaScript code.</p>

<h2>Northeastern University</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/">Northeastern's College of Computer and
Information Science </a> was the first college in the nation devoted to
Computer Science. As an independent college within a large university, they
have the agility to form interdisciplinary programs with all other academic
units and this has led to ties with Arts &amp; Sciences, Business, Engineering,
Criminal Justice, and the Bouve College of Health Sciences at the undergraduate
and graduate level.</p>

<p>Please consider <a href="/foundation/donate.html">making a contribution</a>
to the Mozilla Foundation so we can continue to make grants to other worthwhile
organizations like Northeastern University.</p>
