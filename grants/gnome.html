<p>Mozilla and GNOME have been longtime collaborators on open source and accessibility issues. The GNOME Foundation sponsors the GNOME project to provide a free desktop environment for Linux systems; GNOME is shipped as the default desktop environment on the majority of Linux distributions for desktops and
workstations. GNOME software is also used for some mobile devices such as Maemo. Mozilla offered this grant in support of greater accessibility to GNOME.</p>

<div id="grant-details">

<h2>Orca rich document browsing extension</h2>
<ul>
  <li id="grant-year"><strong>Year:</strong> 2008</li>
  <li id="grant-amount"><strong>Amount:</strong> $8,000</li>
  <li id="grant-focus"><strong>Focus:</strong> Accessibility</li>
</ul>

<p>Work executed by Scott Haeger between January and March 2008 continued work on ARIA widget support, live region support, Collection bug fixes and Collection integration into Orca. See the <a href="/grants/gnome-haeger-report.html">final report</a> for more details.

<h2>GNOME Outreach Program: Accessibility</h2>
<ul>
  <li id="grant-year"><strong>Year:</strong> 2008</li>
  <li id="grant-amount"><strong>Amount:</strong> $10,000</li>
  <li id="grant-focus"><strong>Focus:</strong> Accessibility</li>
</ul>

<p>In March 2008, <a href="http://www.gnome.org/press/releases/2008-03-mofojoins.html">GNOME and Mozilla announced</a> tigher, more 
formal collaboration. Mozilla joined the GNOME Foundation advisory board while reaffirming commitments to integrate with the GNOME 
platform for the XUL development platform. This $10,000 grant funded Gnome's <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/outreach/a11y/">Outreach Program</a> for Accessibility. 
This development challenge had three goals:
<ol>
<li>Increase awareness of accessibility-related issues and how they relate to computer applications</li>
<li>Encourage and inspire people to work on those issues</li>
<li>Help the free software community improve its support for accessibility</li>
</ol>
Prize winners included WHO AND WHO AND WHAT DID THEY DO.</p>

<h2>CSUN Accessibility Conference</h2>
<ul>
  <li id="grant-year"><strong>Year:</strong> 2009</li>
  <li id="grant-amount"><strong>Amount:</strong> $10,000</li>
  <li id="grant-focus"><strong>Focus:</strong> Accessibility</li>
</ul>

<p>After seeing the good that came of 2008's support, Mozilla offered another grant to GNOME, leaving it to them to identify how the funds could be most effectively spent. After <a href="http://www.gnome.org/press/releases/2010-02-mozilla-accessibility.html">GNOME</a> and <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/blog/2010/02/04/mozilla-gnome-accessibility/">Mozilla</a> jointly announced the grant and shortly after it the funds were targeted to send developers to the <a href="http://www.csunconference.org/index.cfm?EID=80000218">25th Annual International CSUN Technology & Persons with Disabilities Conference</a>. $6,933 of this grant money went toward travel and hotel rooms for participants in CSUN, and the remainder of the funds were applied to the creation of GNOME's booth at CSUN and GNOME's general accessibility fund.</p>

GNOME Executive Director Stormy Peters reported, "The CSUN Conference is one of the premier technology conferences for people with disabilities, and by holding a GNOME <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Accessibility/Hackfest2010">accessibility hackfest</a> at the conference, GNOME can ensure a diverse group of GNOME developers are immersed in the accessibility space with direct hands-on interaction with end users. The Mozilla grant also covered the cost of the GNOME booth at CSUN, in addition to the hackfest and travel.The booth was great. Most of the people we talked to were not aware that there were free software accessibility solutions available."</p>

<p>GNOME contributor Etain Isaacson reported:</p>

<blockquote>CSUN is one of the largest and most important gatherings on the topic of technology and persons with disabilities. While most technology that was showcased at this event was proprietary and typically had a high price point, we were offering a free personal computing platform that was feature rich, easy to use, and accessible to people with many disabilities.</p>

<p>Because of different laws and regulations, technology accessibility is a consideration and concern primarily to large employers and government agencies. We were able to demonstrate our software and solutions to representatives of some of the largest employers in the United States (such as Social Security). We hopefully made our case that Free Software, besides being a competitive choice, is accessible by definition.</p>

<p>We held 3 different GNOME-related talks, where we demonstrated Orca, our screen reader, highlighted smaller assistive technology projects, and introduced participants to the culture of GNOME and the power of contribution.</p>

<p>In addition to our presence at the conference, an accessibility hackfest took place. During the hackfest we have made progress towards our GNOME 3.0 goals (DBus AT-SPI and GNOME Shell accessibility), and transitioned responsibilities as Willie Walker stepped down from his leadership role.</p>

<h2>General Accessibility Support</h2>
<ul>
  <li id="grant-year"><strong>Year: 2010</li>
  <li id="grant-amount"><strong>Amount:</strong> $10,000</li>
  <li id="grant-focus"><strong>Focus:</strong> Accessibility</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on the self-evident value of GNOME's activities in Accessibility, Mozilla renewed its support, offering $10,000 to be applied at GNOME's discretion to Accessibility projects such as the ORCA screen reader or the 2011 CSUN conference this coming March.</p>

<h2>More Information</h2>

<p>GNOME is a long-time open source sister project to Mozilla. Mozilla is a
member of the GNOME Advisory Board, both organizations have collaborated on accessibility-related work such as <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Orca/Firefox">enhancements</a> to the
<a href="http://projects.gnome.org/orca/">Orca</a> screen reader, which is key to providing accessibility of Firefox on
Linux-based systems.</p>

<h2>GNOME</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.gnome.org/">The GNOME project</a> provides two things:
The GNOME desktop environment, an intuitive and attractive desktop for users,
and the GNOME development platform, an extensive framework for building
applications that integrate into the rest of the desktop. GNOME is Free
Software and part of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">the GNU project</a>,
dedicated to giving users and developers the ultimate level of control over
their desktops, their software, and their data.</p>

<p>Please consider <a href="/foundation/donate.html">making a contribution</a>
to Mozilla so we can continue to make grants to other worthwhile
organizations like GNOME.</p>
