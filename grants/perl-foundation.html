<p>The primary focus of this project was to get Perl 6 on Parrot development
"over the hump" and acquire a critical mass of infrastructure, developers, and
tools from which sustained further development of Perl 6 can take place. The
project proposal identified five specific expected outcomes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A working Perl 6 on Parrot implementation that supports commonly used
    Perl constructs and operators</li>
  <li>Review and improvements to the Perl 6 language test suite</li>
  <li>A substantially complete Parrot Compiler Toolkit, with documentation</li>
  <li>Ongoing, active development efforts for other languages based on the
    Parrot Compiler Toolkit</li>
  <li>An increased number of participants in Perl 6 and Parrot design,
    implementation, and testing</li>
</ul>

<h2>More Information</h2>

<p>This project was successful in all of its goals. Perl 6 on Parrot ("Rakudo")
is being used to write and test Perl 6 programs and language features, and has
become a strong driver for improving the coverage and accuracy of the test
suite (and indeed, of the Perl 6 language specification itself). Continual
reporting and publication on Perl 6 and Parrot activities continues to attract
increased interest and participation from the wider community.</p>

<p>Moreover, this project helped jump-start even larger fund-raising efforts.
In May 2008 the Perl Foundation received a $200,000 philanthropic donation from
Ian Hague; roughly half of this donation is intended to continue the Perl 6
development efforts that have been part of this project. And, as mentioned
earlier, Jonathan Worthington and others are receiving grants for continued
work on Rakudo Perl and Parrot.</p>
