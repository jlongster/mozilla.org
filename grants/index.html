<p>Since 2006, Mozilla has awarded over two million dollars to fund projects
that contribute to the health of the Open Web. The Mozilla Grants program is
jointly funded by the Mozilla Corporation and the Mozilla Foundation, and
awards financial support to individuals and organizations whose work supports
and enhances the mission and values of the Mozilla Project.</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>

<p>Mozilla makes grants to individuals and organizations all over the world. We
mainly fund activity that supports the Mozilla Grants program's four target
areas:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/grants/accessibility/">Accessibility:</a> Mozilla believes that
    the Internet truly is for everyone, and that those with disabilities should
    be able to participate on the Web along with their sighted and hearing
    peers. As part of our <a
    href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Accessibility/Strategy">accessibility
    strategy</a>, we are funding the development of free, open source options
    for those with visual and auditory impairments.</li>
  <li><a href="/grants/community/">Community:</a> Mozilla offers suppport to
    the broader free culture and open source community, as part of Mozilla's
    general effort to 'give back', aiding in the creation of technologies and
    projects that increase the health of the open Web ecosystem.</li>
  <li><a href="/grants/education/">Education:</a> As part of Mozilla's broader
    <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Education/">education initiative</a>, we
    support educational institutions that are producing the next generation of
    innovative creators of software.</li>
  <li><a href="/grants/opensource/">Open Source:</a> These grants support the
    creation and adoption of Web standards, open source principles, and the
    overall principles of transparency, collaboration, and openness that free
    and open source software projects adhere to.</li>
</ul>
