<p>In cooperation with the NSS development team and Mozilla Corporation
developers investigated the problem of providing OCSP stapling support for
Apache and other open source SSL/TLS-enabled server software incorporating the
OpenSSL library. The Open Source Software Institute (OSSI) was identified as
having extensive experience with OpenSSL, and in particular was the lead
organization responsible for getting US government FIPS 140-2 validation of
OpenSSL.</p>

<p>OSSI proposed a three-prong approach to the solution: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Add OCSP stapling support to OpenSSL 0.9.9-dev</li>
  <li>Backport such support to the OpenSSL 0.9.8 release</li>
  <li>Enhance the mod_ssl module in Apache 2.2.4 to support OCSP stapling</li>
</ul>

<h2>More Information</h2>

<p>The previous recommended method for checking certificate revocation is the
Online Certificate Status Protocol or OCSP. In the original OCSP model,
browsers and other clients communicate directly with so-called OCSP responders
operated by CAs, sending the responder information about the certificate to be
checked and receiving from it a response (digitally signed by the CA)
indicating the certificate's status.</p>

<p>However in the web context this model imposes a large burden on CAs and
their OCSP responders. Browsers can cache OCSP responses, which minimizes the
number of OCSP queries an individual browser will generate for a given
certificate. However each new browser visiting an SSL/TLS-enabled site will
generate at least one OCSP query, and thus in the case of high-traffic sites
the total volume of OCSP queries directed to the CA will be very large. Such
performance-related concerns have impeded adoption of OCSP both by CAs and by
browser vendors.</p>

<p>One alternative to this model is for web sites to make OCSP requests on
their own behalf (i.e., to check the status of their own server certificates),
to cache the responses, and then to provide the responses to browsers as part
of the initial handshake protocol. (Note that since the OCSP response is
digitally signed by the CA it doesn't matter if the browser gets it directly
from the CA or indirectly from the web site.) A standard technique for doing
this has been defined for TLS (see section 3.6 of RFC 3546, "Transport Layer
Security (TLS) Extensions") and has been implemented by Microsoft in IE and
IIS. It is formally known as the TLS certificate status extension, and
informally as "OCSP stapling".</p>

<p>The development team for NSS, the crypto library used in Mozilla-based
products, plans to implement OCSP stapling in a future version of NSS. This
will provide future versions of Firefox the necessary support to implement the
client-side functionality for OCSP stapling. Unfortunately this is only half
the problem, as equivalent server-side support would need to be implemented for
the Apache web server and other server software using the OpenSSL crypto
library, and there are insufficient resources to implement OCSP stapling in
OpenSSL in the absence of dedicated funding. Given that this lack will a)
potentially impact Firefox support for EV certificates and b) will more
generally disadvantage open source alternatives to proprietary software, the
Mozilla Foundation decide to help get OCSP stapling implemented in OpenSSL and
Apache.</p>
