<h2>More Information</h2>

<p>Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS) 140-1 and
140-2 are US government standards for implementations of cryptographic
modules&#x2014;that is, hardware or software that encrypts and decrypts data or
performs other cryptographic operations. Additional FIPS standards govern
cryptographic algorithms. Many products sold to the US government must comply
with one or more of the FIPS standards. Some financial institutions informally
consider FIPS validation an important seal of approval. The FIPS standards for
both cryptographic modules and cryptographic algorithms are maintained by the
U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). NIST runs a
Cryptographic Module Validation (CMV) Program that formally validates
cryptographic modules for conformance to FIPS 140-1 or FIPS 140-2. FIPS
validation under this program is a rigorous process that takes many months. The
NSS cryptographic module has been FIPS 140-1 validated under this program.
Products that use NSS can highlight FIPS validation as a widely acknowledged
indication of high standards and rigorous testing, especially if they are
intended for use by federal agencies and financial institutions.</p>

<h2>Altan Labs</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.saic.com/infosec/testing-accreditation/">Atlan Labs</a>
was a a cybersecurity product testing firm based in McLean, Virginia that
provided Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 and 201
validations. Atlan was acquired by <a href="http://www.saic.com/">SAIC</a> in
July 2009.</p>
