<p>In December 2007, Mozilla decided to participate in Creative Commons' "5x5
Challenge." Beginning in 2008, we've pledged $100,000 per year for five years
to support open licensing on the Web, developing hybrid organizations, and
maturing the concept of the web as an ecology of shared ideas.</p>

<h2>More Information</h2>

<p>This grant program enables Mozilla and CC, two organizations with similar
values and a vision of the web as an open, collaborative ecosystem, to work
closely together with sustainable results. Supporting open content licensing
infrastructure is a critical part of building the open internet. Mozilla and CC
continue to collaborate on the best use of this funding.</p>
