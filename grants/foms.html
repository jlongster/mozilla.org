<h2>More Information</h2>

<p>Mozilla has supported this annual gathering as a sponsor for the last two
years. The bulk of these funds were used to cover the travel expenses of key
participants who otherwise would have been unable to attend. This meeting hosts
important discussions on open codecs, HTML specifications, browsers, and hands
on work towards specifications that may become very relevant to video in
browsers.</p>

<h2>Annodex Association</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.annodex.org/">Annodex Association </a> a
public-good, non-profit incorporated Australian association that is focused on
furthering the open Annodex technology. The Annodex technology is a set of open
specifications and software that allow the creation of Webs of audio and video.
Just like HTML, HTTP and URLs enabled text documents to be turned into
hypertext for the World Wide Web, Annodex allows to turn audio and video into
hypermedia for the Web.</p>
