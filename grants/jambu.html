<p>Jambu is a pointer and switch project that improves accessibility for people with physical disabilities. Users with limited physical control or motor difficulties are unable to usefully access a computer via the default mouse and keyboard devices. The possibilities for improving the efficiency of On Screen Keyboard (OSK) usage are vast, and yet the community is drastically underserved. This grant project aimed to imporve switch access to Firefox on Windows, with the greater goal of providing transparent alternative input access to computers. Users served by this project may include adults who have experienced a debilitating accident or a stroke, people with congential physical disabilities, children with multiple disabilities, and those with learning difficulties or limited education who often need to learn to use a switch through specialist educational programs.</p>

<h2>Phase One</h2>
<ul>
  <li id="grant-year"><strong>2006:</strong> $15,000</li>
  <li id="grant-focus"><strong>Focus:</strong> Accessibility</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Phase one of the Jambu grant supported researching GOK, onBeard, SAW and proprietary scanning switch overlay programs to determine the best of current practices, as well as physical and software driver switch interfaces to PCs. At the end of this phase, developer Steve Lee created a partially successful build of XULRunner with Python and had successful early collaboration with OSKng, IA2, GOK and others. Initial Jambu documentation and requirements were produced. A potentially usable temporary platform was created in the form of a Minefield addon, although efforts concentrated on building the required custom XULRunner. This is the desired platform and is also a shared requirement with the IA2poke project.</p>

<h2>Phase Two</h2>
<ul>
  <li id="grant-year"><strong>2007:</strong> $10,000</li>
  <li id="grant-focus"><strong>Focus:</strong> Accessibility</li>
</ul>
</div>

Phase took took the basic framework established in Phase one and built upon it. Developer Steve Lee collaborated with clinical organizations and users to ensure that end user needs were met, establishing a public discussion forum at <a href="http://oatsoft.org">OATSoft</a>. An early version of Jambu switch access was implemented for Firefox on Linux, developing a basic OSK with attractive visuals and an in-application selection.

<h2>Jambu</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.oatsoft.org/Software/jambu/">Jambu</a> makes the web easier to access for those who interact with computers using switches and head mice or other types of Alternative Input device. It is designed for users with mobility impairments who find keyboard and mice difficult or impossible to use.</p>

<p>Please consider <a href="/foundation/donate.html">making a contribution</a>
to the Mozilla Foundation so we can continue to make grants to other worthwhile
projects such as Jambu.</p>
