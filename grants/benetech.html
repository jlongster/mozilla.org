<p>This project, begun in 2008, is funding the development of an open-source,
browser-based DAISY reader that will enable people with print disabilities to
read accessible text using Firefox. Future plans include enhancements beyond
traditional accessibility functions for a more full, rich web experience for those with visual impairments.</p>

<h2>More Information</h2>

<p>Benetech operates their <a href="http://bookshare.org/">BookShare site</a>
to provide books and other publications designed to be accessible to readers
with print disabilities (e.g., people who have impaired vision, dyslexia, or
other conditions); the books are provided in <a
href="http://www.bookshare.org/about/informationDAISY">DAISY format</a> as
text-only books, audio books, or text books with accompanying audio. DAISY
e-book readers have traditionally been stand-alone desktop applications, which
can make reading e-books online awkward. In 2008 the Mozilla Foundation
provided a $38,000 grant to Benetech to support development of a Firefox
extension to read DAISY books within the browser itself. The grant was matched
by an additional $38,000 from Benetech. The extension's source code (licensed
under the same terms as Mozilla code) is currently available for public
download as a release candidate.</p>
