coalition of organizations and individuals committed to the idea that the power
of moving image should belong to everyone. OVA is a framework to help incubate
new projects and campaigns. Core OVA members like Mozilla, PCF, and Kaltura are
actively building this future with free and open source software for
video&#x2014;Firefox, Miro, and the Kaltura platform. Other OVA members lead
research efforts into how to ensure an open video ecosystem.</p>
