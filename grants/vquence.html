<h2>More Information</h2>

<p>In the spring of 2008 Mozilla became concerned about the lack of support for
deaf and blind Firefox users. Firefox 3.5 included built-in open video support
using the &lt; video &gt; tag, but there was no built-in method to provide
captions or audio descriptions. Mozilla identified Dr. Silvia Pfeiffer and her
company Vquence as the best resource for creating a plan for open video
accessibility. $25,000 was granted to Vquence in the fall of 2008 to create a
plan for technology that would add textual and audio descriptions to Ogg media
files</p>

<p>This grant was renewed in 2009 to begin implementing this plan. The grant of
$25,000 will lay the foundation for rolling out free, open-source options for
those with visual or hearing impairments who wish to take advantage of what
open video has to offer.</p>

<p>In 2010, Mozilla offered a further renewal with two phases: the first focuses on a Firefox implementation for external accessibility files for media, the second focuses on a Firefox implementation for embedded accessibility tracks in media. Current work includes developing best practices for non-synchronised text alternates for media accessibility, dealing with external alternate text files, dealing with embedded alternates, and textual audio descriptions.
