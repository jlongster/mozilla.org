<p>In a crisis environment, maintaining lines of communication is critically
important. <a href="http://www.ushahidi.com">Ushahidi</a> is deploying its open
source platform that enables citizen reporting in crisis situations. A deadly
earthquake struck Chile on February 27, 2010, cutting off many vulnerable
people from traditional sources of information. Mozilla has awarded a $10,000
to enable Ushahidi volunteers to train Chilean civilians and government
officials to utilize the Ushahidi platform during the relief effort.</p>

<h2>More Information</h2>

<p>This grant will allowed Ushahidi volunteers to travel to Chile to provide
training to Chilean citizens and government representatives. Deploying the
Ushahidi platform allowed Chileans to gather on-the-ground reports of
conditions in earthquake recovery zones. Ushahidi initially managed this
project from its offices in the United States, but it became important to get the
management of Ushahidi-Chile to the the geographical setting it served. In <a
href="http://blog.ushahidi.com/index.php/2010/03/15/mozilla-foundation-supports-ushahidi-chile/">Ushahidi's
announcement of the grant</a>, Patrick Meier explained that "The majority of
this grant will be instrumental in moving this initiative to the next phase: to
Chile. We have been communicating with various Chilean organizations to
transition the Ushahidi platform to local Chileans."</p>

<p>Ushahidi provided a <a href="/grants/ushahidi-chile-report.html">full report</a> of the activities related to this grant.</p>

<h2>Ushahidi</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.ushahidi.com/">Ushahidi</a>, which means "testimony" in
Swahili, provides a free, open source platform that enables the collaboration
of citizen journalists during a time of crisis. After successful use of this
technology in Kenya, Gaza, and during the H1N1 Influenza outbreak, Ushahidi has
developed goals of scaling the organization in order to make the tool as widely
accessible as possible, to increase the platform&#x2019;s user-friendliness,
and to help support the community that has grown around Ushahidi.</p>

<p>Please consider <a href="/foundation/donate.html">making a contribution</a>
to the Mozilla Foundation so we can continue to make grants to other worthwhile
organizations such as Ushahidi.</p>
