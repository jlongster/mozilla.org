<p>This grant provided funds to the <a href="http://cita.uiuc.edu/">University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</a> and <a href="http://www.paciellogroup.com/">The Paciello Group</a> for
their joint work on Firebug accessibility. This project will take the features that are most useful to Web developers from the existing Firefox Accessibility Extension and add them to the Firebug "A11y" extension.</p>

<p>The Paciello Group is currently at work on the fourth phase of this project. Full time work will bring changes to the RuleEngine&#x2019;s Interface (which is based on YSlow) as well as Firebug's A11y module (which manages accessibility for Firebug as a whole) so that the two can work together. These changes will then be applied to the YSlow interface itself, which will make the YSlow interface accessible as well.ext steps will involve creating and implementing remaining rule logic in JQuery and the YSlow framework. This work, scheduled to be completed in July 2010, will produce Firebug 1.6 beta.

<p>This project is a key item for Mozilla's accessibility strategy. The basic
goal is to mainstream accessibility for Web applications by building
accessibility testing functions and associated test cases into <a
href="http://getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a>, a popular tool used by many web
developers. This will make accessibility more native to Web applications, as
opposed to having accessibility testing confined to special
accessibility-focused tools used by only a small subset of developers.</p>

<p>UIUC's work on this project was part of their <a href="http://firefox.cita.uiuc.edu/">larger effort toward Firefox accessibility</a>, particularly the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5809">Firefox Accessibility Extension</a>. The Paciello Group has done previous work on Firefox accessibility, and this grant targeted the need to make Firebug, a Firefox add-on popular with Web developers, more accessible to those with visual and hearing impairments.</p>
