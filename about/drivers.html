  <p>Drivers provide project management for mozilla.org milestone releases. 
    The drivers provide guidance to developers as to which bug fixes are important 
    for a given mozilla.org release. Drivers also make a range of tree management 
    decisions. The drivers are particularly active after the trunk is frozen 
    for a milestone release, and in managing the milestone branch until a 
    milestone is released. During this time the the Drivers watch the checkins 
    very closely, and generally require that every patch be reviewed by the 
    drivers before it is checked in. This review is not focused on the technical 
    merits of the code itself. We use review and super-review for that, and 
    the drivers expect that a fix proposed for a milestone branch has already 
    been reviewed and approved by relevant reviewers. Instead, the drivers 
    review focuses on the importance of that particular fix to the milestone 
    release, and the risk to stability and performance presented by that particular 
    patch. So a driver may say &quot;This is a great patch, please make sure 
    it's checked into the trunk right away. But our milestone release is tomorrow, 
    we're currently waiting for two identified patches before we release the 
    milestone, and so don't check this patch into the current milestone branch.&quot;</p>
  <p>So being a driver requires having the time, willingness and ability to 
    focus on checkins to the Mozilla tree. Most but not all drivers are programmers 
    themselves. Drivers need to be intimately familiar with the tree: when 
    patches are checked in, which patches caused the tree to go red, which 
    patches caused regressions, interactions between patches, dependencies 
    among patches, and progress on fixing critical patches.</p>
  <p>This level of involvement isn't required all the time, but is required 
    from the time the trunk freezes for a milestone until that milestone is 
    released.. Not every driver participates equally in each milestone, or 
    each day of each milestone. For example, a Mozilla milestone release might 
    come at a particularly inconvenient time for a driver. Perhaps his or 
    her employer has a release scheduled for the same time. Or perhaps the 
    driver has exams to take. In that case, we ask the driver to let the others 
    know that s/he will not be available for that release.</p>
