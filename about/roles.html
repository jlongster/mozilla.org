<p>The Mozilla project is governed by a virtual management team made up of experts from various parts of the community.  Some people with leadership roles 
are employed to work on Mozilla and others are not.  Leadership roles are granted based on how active an individual is within the community as well as the 
quality and nature of his or her contributions. This meritocracy is a resilient and effective way to guide our global community.  The different community 
leadership roles include:</p>

     <dl>
      <dt>Module Owners and Peers<a name="module-owners"></a></dt>
        <dd><a href="../hacking/module-ownership.html">Module owners</a> are responsible for leading the development of a module 
        of code or a community activity. This role requires a range of tasks, including approving patches to be checked 
        into the module or resolving conflicts among community members. Lists of <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Modules">code module owners</a> and
	<a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Module_Owners_Activities_Modules">non-code module owners</a> are available.</dd>

      <dt>Super-Reviewers<a name="super-reviewers"></a></dt>
        <dd><a href="../hacking/reviewers.html">Super-reviewers</a> are a designated 
        group of strong hackers who review code for its effects on the overall 
        state of the tree and adherence to Mozilla coding guidelines. Super-review generally follows 
        code review by the module owner, and the approval of a super-reviewer 
        is generally required to check in code. More information on 
        code review can be found in the
        <a href="../hacking/code-review-faq.html">mozilla.org code review FAQ</a>.</dd>

      <dt>Release Drivers<a name="release-drivers"></a></dt>
	<dd><a href="/about/drivers">Release drivers</a> provide project management for milestone releases. The drivers provide guidance to developers as to
	which bug fixes are important for a given release and also make a range of tree management decisions.</dd>

      <dt>Bugzilla Component Owners<a name="component-owners"></a></dt>
        <dd><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describecomponents.cgi?product=mozilla.org">Bugzilla component owners</a> 
        are the default recipient of bugs filed against that component. 
	Component owners are expected to review 
        bug reports regularly, reassign bugs to correct owners, ensure test cases 
        exist, track the progress toward resolving important fixes, and otherwise 
        manage the bugs in the component. The Bugzilla component 
        owner and the related module owner may be the same person, but in many 
        cases they will be different.</dd>

      <dt>Ultimate Decision-Makers<a name="ultimate-decision-makers"></a><a name="benevolent-dictators" class="obsolete-anchor-do-not-use"></a></dt>
        <dd>
        The ultimate decision-maker(s) are trusted members of the community who 
        have the final say in the case of disputes. This is a 
        <a href="http://fringe.davesource.com/Fringe/Computers/Philosophy/Homesteading_The_Noosphere/homesteading-15.html">model</a> 
        followed by many successful open source projects, although most of those 
        communities only have one person in this role, and they are sometimes called 
        the "benevolent dictator". Mozilla has evolved to have two people in this role - 
        Brendan Eich has the final say in any technical dispute and Mitchell Baker 
        has the final say in any non-technical dispute.  This has been the case since 
        1998 for Brendan and 1999 for Mitchell.</dd>
