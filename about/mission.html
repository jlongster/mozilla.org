  <h3>What we do</h3>
  <p>We do this by creating great software, like the <a 
  href="http://www.firefox.com">Firefox</a> browser, and building movements, like <a href="http://www.drumbeat.org">Drumbeat</a>, that give people
  tools to take control of their online lives.</p>
  
  <h3>What we strive for</h3>
  <p>As a <a href="/foundation">non-profit organization</a>, we define success in terms of building communities and enriching peopleâ€™s lives instead of benefiting shareholders.
  We believe in the power and potential of the Internet and want to see it thrive for everyone, everywhere.</p>
  
  <h3>Who we work with</h3>
  <p>Building a better Internet is an ambitious goal, but we believe that it is possible when people who share our passion get involved. 
  Coders, artists, writers, testers, surfers, students, grandparents&mdash;anyone who cares about the web can help make it even better.  
  Find out <a href="/contribute">how you can help</a>.</p>
  
  <h3>What drives us</h3>
  <p>Read the <a href="/about/manifesto">Mozilla Manifesto</a> to learn more about the values and principles that guide the pursuit of our mission.</p>
