  <h1 id="page-title">History of the Mozilla Project</h1>
  <p>The Mozilla project <a href="http://www.viddler.com/explore/coderush/videos/1/">was created</a> in 1998 with the <a 
  href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021001071727/wp.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease558.html">release of the Netscape browser suite source code</a> 
  that was intended to harness the creative power of thousands of programmers on the Internet and fuel unprecedented levels of innovation in the 
  browser market.  Within the <a href="http://www-archive.mozilla.org/mozilla-at-one.html">first year</a>, new community members from around the world 
  had already contributed new functionality, enhanced existing features and became engaged in the management and planning of the project itself.</p>
  
  <p>By creating an open community, the Mozilla project had become <a href="http://www-archive.mozilla.org/stevecase.html">larger than any one 
  company</a>.  Community members got involved and expanded the scope of the project's original <a 
  href="http://www-archive.mozilla.org/mission.html">mission</a>&mdash;instead of just working on Netscape's next browser, people started creating <a 
  href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/mozilla/2002/09/12/mozilla_browsers.html">a variety of browsers</a>, <a 
  href="http://www.bugzilla.org">development tools</a> and a range of other <a href="/projects/">projects</a>.  People 
  contributed to Mozilla in different ways, but everyone was passionate about creating free software that would enable people to have a choice in how 
  they experienced the Internet.</p>
  
  <p>After several years of development, <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/articles/article2278.html">Mozilla 1.0</a>, the first major 
  version, was released in 2002.  This version featured many improvements to the browser, email client and other applications included in the 
  suite, but not many people were using it.  By 2002, well <a href="http://www.onestat.com/html/aboutus_pressbox4.html">over 90% of Internet 
  users</a> were browsing with Internet Explorer.  Not many people noticed at the time, but the first version of Phoenix (later renamed to 
  Firefox) was also released by Mozilla community members that year with the goal of providing the <a 
  href="http://www-archive.mozilla.org/projects/firefox/charter.html">best possible browsing experience</a> to the widest possible set of 
  people.</p>
  
  <p>In 2003, the Mozilla project created the Mozilla Foundation, an <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/press/mozilla-foundation.html">independent 
  non-profit organization</a> supported by individual donors and a variety of companies.  The new Mozilla Foundation continued the role of managing the 
  daily operations of the project and also officially took on the role of promoting <a href="/about/manifesto">openness, 
  innovation, and opportunity</a> on the Internet.  It did this by continuing to release software, such as Firefox and Thunderbird, and expanding to 
  new areas, such as providing <a href="/foundation/grants/">grants</a> to support accessibility improvements on the Web.</p>
  
  <p><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/press/mozilla-2004-11-09.html">Firefox 1.0</a> was released in 2004 and became a big success.  In less than 
  a year, Firefox had been downloaded over <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/press/mozilla-2005-10-19.html">100 million times</a>.  New versions 
  of Firefox have come out regularly since then and keep setting <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/en-US/worldrecord/">new records</a>.  The 
  popularity of Firefox has helped bring choice back to users.  In 2008, Firefox reached <a 
  href="http://www.tgdaily.com/content/view/40381/113/">20% worldwide market share</a> and renewed competition has <a 
  href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/press/mozilla-2006-12-04.html">accelerated innovation</a> and improved the Internet for everyone.</p>
  
  <p>Mozilla celebrated its <a href="http://www-archive.mozilla.org/mozilla-ten-year.html">10th anniversary</a> in 2008.  In ten years the community 
  has shown that commercial companies can benefit by collaborating in open source projects and that great end user products can be produced as 
  open source software.  More people than ever before are using the Internet and are experiencing it <a 
  href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all.html">in their own language</a>.  A sustainable organization has been created that uses market 
  mechanisms to support a public benefit mission and this model has been reused by others to create open, transparent and collaborative 
  organizations in a <a href="http://open-government.us/">broad</a> <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org">range</a> <a 
  href="http://creativecommons.org/">of areas</a>.</p>
  
  <p>The next ten years have challenges and opportunities equal to those of our first decade.  There's no guarantee that the Internet will 
  remain open or enjoyable or safe.  Mozilla will continue to provide an opportunity for people to make their voices heard and to shape their 
  own online lives.  Of course, we're not alone in doing this.  The Mozilla community, as well as other open source projects and other public 
  benefit organizations, exists only because of the people who are engaged with making our common goals a reality.  If you want to join us in 
  our mission, please <a href="/contribute/">get involved</a>.</p>
