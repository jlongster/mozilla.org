<h2><a name="support-policy"
   id="support-policy"></a>Support Newsgroups Cancellation Policy (mozilla.support.*)</h2>

  <p>The support newsgroups are monitored by the support newsgroup moderator and his assistants (if any).</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Uncivil Posts</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>The first rule of the <a href="etiquette.html">etiquette guidelines</a> is
        to be civil. If they agree that a post contains a personal attack, they will
        immediately remove the post and (if possible) notify the poster by private e-mail.</p>
     </dd>

    <dt>Off-Topic Posts and Other Etiquette Violations</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>If they agree that someone is regularly
        off-topic or repeatedly violates the 
        <a href="etiquette.html">etiquette guidelines</a> in other
        ways, they will warn them by private e-mail (or in the newsgroup if the
        e-mail address cannot be determined). If they later agree that the
        behaviour has not changed, they will notify the person by e-mail (or
        newsgroup post, as above) and then start to cancel any and all
        infringing posts from that person, without warning or comment.</p>

        <p>At least the first time round, an e-mailed assurance of reformation, plus
        a practical demonstration of one month in length (where the
        group feels the need to cancel no or very few posts), resets the process.</p>
      </dd>
  </dl>

<h2><a name="other-policy"
   id="other-policy"></a>Other Newsgroups Cancellation Policy</h2>

<p>Currently, no non-spam messages are cancelled in other Mozilla newsgroups.</p>
