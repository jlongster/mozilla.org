  <h1 id="page-title">Mozilla Organizations</h1>
  
  <p>Mozilla is a global community of people <a href="/about/mission.html">creating a better Internet</a>. We build public benefit into 
  the Internet by creating free, open source products and technologies that improve the online experience for people everywhere.</p>
  
  <p>There are several organizations that support the Mozilla community and <a href="/about/manifesto">Mozilla's 
  principles</a>. They include the non-profit Mozilla Foundation as well as the wholly owned taxable subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation. 
  Mozilla considers itself a <a href="http://commonspace.wordpress.com/category/hybrid/">hybrid organization</a>, combining 
  non-profit and market strategies to ensure the Internet remains a shared public resource.</p>
  
  <p>This page provides information about the various organizations and their relationships to each other. If you have any questions about this, please feel 
  free to <a href="/contact">contact us</a>.</p>
