    <p><a href="mailto:jat@princeton.edu">The component security</a> <a rel="glossary"
    href="terms.html">Terminology</a> page gives a general explaination of many of the
    terms on this page. This document describes the security model used in Mozilla and
    provides information on how you can create signed JavaScript applications which can
    access expanded privileges.</p>


    <p>There are two security policies in JavaScript:</p>


    <ul>
        <li>The <em>same origin</em> policy is the default policy. It dates from
        Navigator 2.0, and Communicator 4.x.</li>


        <li>The <em>signed script</em> policy is similar to that of Communicator 4.x.
        This policy for JavaScript is based upon the Java security model, called
        <em>object signing</em>. To make use of the new policy in JavaScript, you must
        use the JavaScript privileges API and then sign your JavaScript scripts.</li>
    </ul>


    <p>This document is intended for JavaScript programmers and it contains the following
    sections:</p>


    <ul class="toc">
        <li><a href="#sameorigin">Same Origin Policy</a>

    <h2><a name="sameorigin" id="sameorigin">Same Origin Policy</a>
    </h2>


    <p>The same origin policy prevents document or script loaded from one origin, from
    getting or setting properties from a of a document from a different origin.</p>


    <p>Mozilla defines the origin as the substring of a URL that includes
    <code>protocol://host</code> where <code>host</code> includes the optional <code>:port</code>
    part. To illustrate, this table gives examples of origin comparisons to the URL
    <code>http://company.com/dir/page.html</code>.</p>


    <table border="1" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="2">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>URL</th>

                <th>Outcome</th>

                <th>Reason</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>


        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><code>http://company.com/dir2/other.html</code>
                </td>

                <td>Success</td>

                <td>
                </td>
            </tr>


            <tr>
                <td><code>http://company.com/dir/inner/another.html</code>
                </td>

                <td>Success</td>

                <td>
                </td>
            </tr>


            <tr>
                <td><code>http://www.company.com/dir/other.html</code>
                </td>

                <td>Failure</td>

                <td>Different domain</td>
            </tr>


            <tr>
                <td><code>file://D|/myPage.htm</code>
                </td>

                <td>Failure</td>

                <td>Different protocol</td>
            </tr>


            <tr>
                <td><code>http://company.com:80/dir/etc.html</code>
                </td>

                <td>Failure</td>

                <td>Different port</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>


    <p>There is one exception to the same origin rule. A script can set the value of
    <code>document.domain</code> to a suffix of the current domain. If it does so, the
    shorter domain is used for subsequent origin checks. For example, assume a script in
    the document at <code>http://www.company.com/dir/other.html</code> executes this
    statement:</p>

    <pre class="code">
document.domain = "company.com";
</pre>

    <p>After execution of that statement, the page would pass the origin check with
    <code>http://company.com/dir/page.html</code>.</p>


    <p>However, using the same reasoning, <code>company.com</code> could NOT set
    <code>document.domain</code> to <code>othercompany.com</code>.</p>

    <h2><a name="signedscript" id="signedscript">Signed Script Policy</a>
    </h2>


    <p>Signing scripts involves generating a <a href="terms.html#sig">digital
    signature</a> and associating that signature with the script it signs. In
    Communicator 4.x, this association was accomplished by adding the ARCHIVE="..."
    attribute to a <code>SCRIPT</code> tag to refer to the <dfn><strong>j</strong>ava
    <strong>ar</strong>chive (JAR)</dfn> containing the signature for the script. In
    Mozilla, this association is handled differently. An entire HTML page and any scripts
    it includes using a <code>&lt;script src="..."</code> tag are signed and placed in a
    <acronym title="Java Archive">JAR</acronym> file along with their associated
    signature. By referring to the HTML page using the
    <code>jar:http://www.site.com/myjar.jar!/signed.html</code> syntax, the signature is
    automatically associated with the script, and verified as part of the loading of the
    page. Special HTML syntax to identify signed scripts (the ARCHIVE and ID attributes)
    is unnecessary in Mozilla and is no longer recognized. The JavaScript security model
    for signed scripts is based upon the Java security model for signed objects from
    Communicator 4.x. By signing a script using a valid <a href=
    "terms.html#cert">certificate</a> issued from a <a href="terms.html#ca">certificate
    authority</a> (such as <a href="http://www.verisign.com">VeriSign</a>) you certify
    that you are the owner of the script and that the script was not modified before
    reaching the end user. Because signed scripts offer this proof of identity, only
    signed scripts can be granted extended privileges by the browser. Using this model
    you can sign any JavaScript in an HTML page or referred to by the HTML page.</p>


    <p>A signed script requests expanded privileges, gaining access to restricted
    information. You can use these expanded privileges to exercise fine-grained control
    over activities beyond those which are normally allowed to JavaScript.</p>


    <p>All access-control decisions boil down to who is allowed to do what. In this
    model, a <strong>principal</strong> represents the "who," the <strong>target</strong>
    represents the "what" and the <strong>privilege</strong> associated with a principal
    represents the authorization (or denial of authorization) for code signed by a
    principal to access a specific privilege.</p>


    <p>Once you have written the script, you sign it using Netscape's SignTool. SignTool
    associates a digital signature with <tt>HTML</tt> and JS files. That digital
    signature is owned by a particular principal (a real-world entity such as Netscape or
    John Smith). The digital signature and the files it signs are both placed in a
    <a href="terms.html#jar">Java Archive (<acronym title="Java Archive">JAR</acronym>)</a> file.</p>


    <p>The associated principal allows the user to confirm the identity of the entity
    which signed the script. It also allows the user to ensure that the script hasn't
    been tampered with since it was signed. The user then can decide whether to grant
    privileges based on the validated identity of the certificate owner and integrity of
    the script.</p>


    <p>You should always keep in mind that a user may deny the privileges requested by
    your script. You should write your scripts to react gracefully to such decisions. See
    the <a href="jssec.html#except">exception handling</a> section.</p>


    <p>This document assumes that you are already familiar with the basic principals of
    object signing, using the JavaScript API and creating digital signatures. The
    following documents provide information on these subjects:</p>

        the current JavaScript projects and has helpful links to other helpful
        pages.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3><a name="codebase" id="codebase">Codebase Principals</a>
    </h3>


    <p>JavaScript supports codebase principals. A <strong>codebase principal</strong> is
    a principal derived from the origin of the script rather than from verifying a
    digital signature of a certificate. Since codebase principals offer weaker security,
    they are disabled by default in Mozilla. Codebase principals do not offer as strong a
    proof of identity, thus end users are unable to make informed choices on whether to
    grant the script extended privileges.</p>


    <p>To enable codebase principals, end users must add this line to the Mozilla
    prefs.js file:</p>

    <pre class="code">
user_pref("signed.applets.codebase_principal_support", true);
</pre>

    <p>For deployment, your scripts should not rely on codebase principals being enabled.
    You might want to enable codebase principals when developing your scripts, but you
    should sign them before delivery.</p>


    <p>Even when codebase principals are disabled, Mozilla keeps track of codebase
    principals to use in enforcement of the same origin security policy, described in
    <a href="#sameorigin">"Same Origin Policy"</a>. Unsigned scripts have an
    associated set of principals that contains a single element, the codebase principal
    for the page containing the script. Signed scripts also have codebase principals in
    addition to the stronger certificate principals.</p>


    <p>With codebase principals enabled, when the user accesses the script, a dialog
    displays similar to the one displayed with signed scripts. The difference is that
    this dialog asks the user to grant privileges based on the URL and doesn't provide
    author verification.</p>


    <h3>Scripts Signed by Different Principals</h3>


    <p>JavaScript differs from Java in several important ways that relate to security.
    Java signs classes and is able to protect internal methods of those classes through
    the public/private/protected mechanism. Marking a method as protected or private
    immediately protects it from an attacker. In addition, any class or method marked
    <tt>final</tt> in Java cannot be extended and so is protected from an attacker.</p>


    <p>On the other hand, because JavaScript has no concept of public and private
    methods, there are no internal methods that could be protected by simply signing a
    class. In addition, all methods can be changed at runtime, so must be protected at
    runtime.</p>


    <p>In JavaScript you can add new properties to existing objects, or replace existing
    properties (including methods) at runtime. You cannot do this in Java. So, once
    again, protection that is automatic in Java must be handled separately in
    JavaScript.</p>


    <p>While the signed script security model for JavaScript is based on the object
    signing model for Java, these differences in the languages mean that when JavaScript
    scripts produced by different principals interact, it is much harder to protect the
    scripts. Because all of the JavaScript code on a single HTML page runs in the same
    process, different scripts on the same page can change each other's behavior. For
    example, a script might redefine a function defined by an earlier script on the same
    page.</p>


    <p>To ensure security, the basic assumption of the JavaScript signed script security
    model is that <em>mixed scripts on an HTML page operate as if they were all signed by
    the intersection of the principals that signed each script</em>. This is very
    important in Mozilla. If you have a web page with signed and unsigned code, the
    entire page will be regarded as unsigned. In addition, only one signature should be
    assigned to each <acronym title="Java Archive">JAR</acronym> file. Mozilla does 
    not currently support multiple signatures.</p>


    <p><a href="#top">[Return to Top]</a>
    </p>


    <h2><a name="privs" id="privs">Using Expanded Privileges</a>
    </h2>


    <p>Mozilla uses the JavaScript privileges API.</p>


    <p>In the simplest case, you add one line of code asking permission to enable a
    <a href="terms.html#priv">privilege</a> which allows a script to access a target. For
    example:</p>

    <pre class="code">
netscape.security.PrivilegeManager.enablePrivilege("UniversalPreferencesRead")<br>        or<br>netscape.security.PrivilegeManager.enablePrivilege("UniversalPreferencesWrite")
</pre>

    <p>When the script calls this function, if the signature is valid or codebase
    principal are enabled, expanded privileges can be granted. If a user has not accessed
    this principal before, a dialog asks the user if he wants to accept the signed code.
    Unlike Communicator 4.x, Mozilla does not display a detailed Java grant dialog,
    rather a simple dialog asking if the principal can be trusted. The user can accept or
    deny and allow their choice to be remembered by the browser. As shown in the second
    example, two privileges may be asked for at once, so only one dialog appears.</p>


    <p>Privileges are granted only in the scope of the requesting function. This scope
    includes any functions called by the requesting function. When the script leaves the
    requesting function, privileges no longer apply.</p>


    <p>The following example demonstrates this by printing:</p>

    <pre>
7: disabled
5: disabled
2: disabled
3: enabled
1: enabled
4: enabled
6: disabled
8: disabled
</pre>

    <p>Function <tt>g</tt> requests expanded privileges, and only the commands and
    functions called after the request and within function <tt>g</tt> are granted
    privileges. It is good practice to enable privileges only when needed, then disable
    the privilege soon after the code is executed. This will help protect against
    potentially dangerous sections of code being run on the user's computer.</p>

    <pre class="code">
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
function printEnabled(i) {
 if (history[0] == "") {
 document.write(i + ": disabled&lt;br&gt;");
 } else {
 document.write(i + ": enabled&lt;br&gt;");
 }
}

function f() {
 printEnabled(1);
}

function g() {
 printEnabled(2);
 netscape.security.PrivilegeManager.enablePrivilege("UniversalBrowserRead");
 printEnabled(3);
 f();
 printEnabled(4);
}

function h() {
 printEnabled(5);
 g();
 printEnabled(6);
}

printEnabled(7);
h();
printEnabled(8);

&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

    <h3><a name="privs-list" id="privs-list">Privileges</a>

    <h4>Example</h4>


    <p>The following script includes a button, that, when clicked, displays an alert
    dialog containing part of the URL history of the browser. To work properly, the
    script must be signed.</p>

    <pre class="code">
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;

function getHistory(i) {
 //Attempt to access privileged information
 return history[i];
}

function getImmediateHistory() {
 //Request privilege
 netscape.security.PrivilegeManager.enablePrivilege("UniversalBrowserRead");
 return getHistory(1);
}

&lt;/script&gt;

    <h2><a name="writing" id="writing">Writing the Script</a>
    </h2>


    <p>This section describes special considerations for writing signed scripts.</p>


    <h3>International Characters in Signed Scripts</h3>


    <p>When used in scripts, international characters can appear in string constants and
    in comments. JavaScript keywords and variables cannot include special international
    characters.</p>


    <p>Scripts that include international characters cannot be signed because the process
    of transforming the characters to the local character set invalidates the signature.
    To work around this limitation:</p>


    <ul>
        <li>Escape the international characters (<tt>'0x\ea'</tt>, and so on).</li>


        <li>Put the data containing the international characters in a hidden form
        element, and access the form element through the signed script.</li>


        <li>Separate signed and unsigned scripts into different layers, and use the
        international characters in the unsigned scripts.</li>


        <li>Remove comments that include international characters.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Hints for Writing Secure JavaScript</h3>


    <h4>Check the Location of the Script</h4>


    <p>If you have signed scripts in pages you have posted to your site, it is possible
    to copy the JAR file from your site and post it on another site. As long as the
    signed scripts themselves are not altered, the scripts will continue to operate under
    your signature. (See <a href="#debughash">"Debugging Invalid Signature
    Errors"</a> for one exception to this rule.)</p>


    <p>If you wish to prevent this, you can force your scripts to work only from your
    site.</p>

    <pre class="code">
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;<br>if (document.URL.match(/^http:\/\/www.company.com\//)) {<br> netscape.security.PrivilegeManager.enablePrivilege(...);<br> // Do your stuff<br>}<br>&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

    <p>Then if the JAR file and script are copied to another site, they no longer work.
    If the person who copies the script alters it to bypass the check on the source of
    the script, the signature is invalidated.</p>


    <h4>Minimize the Trusted Code Base</h4>


    <p>In security parlance, the <dfn><strong>Trusted Code Base</strong> (TCB)</dfn> is
    the set of code that has privileges to perform restricted actions. One way to improve
    security is reduce the size of the <abbr title="Trusted Code Base">TCB</abbr>, which 
    then gives fewer points for attack or opportunities for mistakes.</p>


    <p>For example, the following code, if executed in a signed script with the user's
    approval, opens a new window containing the history of the browser:</p>

    <pre class="code">
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
netscape.security.PrivilegeManager.enablePrivilege("UniversalBrowserAccess");
var win = window.open();
for (var i=0; i &lt; history.length; i++) {
 win.document.writeln(history[i] + "&lt;br&gt;");
}
win.close();
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

    <p>The <abbr title="Trusted Code Base">TCB</abbr> in this instance is 
    the entire script because privileges are acquired at
    the beginning and never reverted. You could reduce the 
    <abbr title="Trusted Code Base">TCB</abbr> by rewriting the program
    as follows:</p>

    <pre class="code">
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
var win = window.open();
netscape.security.PrivilegeManager.enablePrivilege("UniversalBrowserAccess");
for (var i=0; i &lt; history.length; i++) {
 win.document.writeln(history[i] + "&lt;br&gt;");
}
netscape.security.PrivilegeManager.revertPrivilege("UniversalBrowserAccess");
win.close();
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

    <p>With this change, the <abbr title="Trusted Code Base">TCB</abbr> becomes only the
    loop containing the accesses to the <code>history</code> property. You could avoid the
    extra call to revert the privilege by introducing a function:</p>

    <pre class="code">
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
function writeArray() {
 netscape.security.PrivilegeManager.enablePrivilege("UniversalBrowserAccess");
 for (var i=0; i &lt; history.length; i++) {
 win.document.writeln(history[i] + "&lt;br&gt;");
 }
}
var win = window.open();
writeArray();
win.close();
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

    <p>The privileges are automatically reverted when <code>writeArray</code> returns, so you
    don't have to do so explicitly.</p>


    <p><a href="#top">[Return to Top]</a>
    </p>


    <h2><a name="signing" id="signing">Signing Scripts</a>
    </h2>


    <p>During development of a script you'll eventually sign, you can use codebase
    principals for testing, as described in <a href="#codebase">"Codebase
    Principals"</a>. Once you've finished modifying the script, you need to sign it. The
    major difference in signing scripts between 4.x and Mozilla is that in Mozilla, the
    entire page must be signed, as opposed to only the script running on the page. For
    any script to be granted expanded privileges, all scripts on or included by an HTML
    page must be signed.</p>


    <p>You can sign JavaScript files (accessed with the <code>src</code> attribute of the
    <code>script</code> tag), inline scripts, event handler scripts JavaScript entities and
    <code>javascript:</code> URLs.</p>


    <h3>Using SignTool</h3>


    <p>Use SignTool to sign scripts. SignTool is a program that signs scripts and HTML
    files, and packages them in a <a href="terms.html#jar">JAR file</a> with the
    signature.</p>


    <p>The <tt>signtool</tt> program extracts scripts from HTML files, signs them, and
    places their <a href="terms.html#sog">digital signatures</a> in the archive specified
    in the command line. It also takes care of copying external JavaScript files loaded
    by the <code>src</code> attribute of the <code>script</code> tag. The 
    <code>script</code> tags in the HTML pages can specify more than one 
    <acronym title="Java Archive">JAR</acronym> file; if so, <tt>signtool</tt> creates
    as many <acronym title="Java Archive">JAR</acronym> files as it needs.</p>


    <p>For information on using this tool, see <em><a href=
    "http://help.netscape.com:80/products/client/mc/mcguide406/docs/zig3.htm">Using
    SignTool</a></em>.</p>


    <p>Here is an example of the syntax needed for signing scripts</p>


    <table border="1" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="2">
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <pre class="code">
% signtool -k"Cert Name" -Z"secure.jar" secure-files/
</pre>

                    <p>This command will create a <acronym title="Java Archive">JAR</acronym> 
                    file (<tt>secure.jar</tt>)
                    signed by <tt>"Cert Name"</tt>. All the JavaScript and HTML files in
                    the directory <tt>secure-files/</tt> will be signed and stored in the
                    <acronym title="Java Archive">JAR</acronym> file.</p>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>


    <h3>After Signing</h3>


    <p>Once you've signed a script, any time you change it you must resign it. For
    JavaScript files, this means you cannot change anything in the file. A change can be
    as simple as adding or removing white space in the script.</p>


    <p>For testing, use SignTool to create a test certificate (see <a href=
    "http://help.netscape.com:80/products/client/mc/mcguide406/docs/zig3.htm">documentation</a>).
    However, end users will not be able to use the test certificate, so remember to
    obtain a certificate from a certificate authority in order to serve a signed script
    on the web.</p>


    <h3><a name="syntax" id="syntax">Accessing a Signed Page</a>
    </h3>


    <p>New in Mozilla is the syntax needed to access signed scripts within <tt>JAR</tt>
    files. The syntax is as follows:</p>

    <pre class="code">
jar:http://www.domain.com/secure-scripts/secure.jar!/thepage.html
</pre>

    <p>Scripts will only be treated as signed if the HTML page that contains them is
    using a URL of this form. Changes to a signed script's byte stream invalidate the
    script's signature. This includes moving the HTML page between platforms that have
    different representations of text. For example, moving an HTML page from a Windows
    server to a UNIX server changes the byte stream and invalidates the signature. (This
    doesn't affect viewing pages from multiple platforms.) To avoid this, you can move
    the page in binary mode. Note that doing so changes the appearance of the page in
    your text editor but not in the browser.</p>


    <p><a href="#top">[Return to Top]</a>
    </p>


    <h2><a name="troubleshoot" id="troubleshoot">Troubleshooting Signed Scripts</a>
    </h2>


    <h3><a name="except" id="except">Exception Handling</a>
    </h3>


    <p>Exception handling is <em>highly</em> recommended when using signed scripts. It
    allows you to deal gracefully with errors or the user choosing to deny a
    privilege.</p>


    <p><strong>For example:</strong>
    </p>

    <pre class="code">
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;<br>function getPriv() {<br>  try {<br>    netscape.security.PrivilegeManager.enablePrivilege("UniversalPreferencesRead");<br>  } catch (err) {<br>    document.write("Sorry, you can not enjoy this site because of " +err+ ".");<br>    return false;<br>  }<br>  document.write("Thanks, privileges accepted");<br><br>  //... Do stuff<br><br>  return true;<br>}<br>&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

    <p>If the user denies the privilege, an exception will be thrown and the program will
    immediately execute the code in the <code>catch</code> section. If there is no catch
    clause, the script will end abroptly, and an error will be shown in the JavaScript
    console.</p>


    <h3>Errors on the JavaScript Console</h3>


    <p>Be sure to check the JavaScript console for errors if your signed scripts do not
    function as expected. Remember, if you are using <a href=
    "#except">exception handling</a>, you will not see the errors in the JS
    Console. You may see errors such as the following:</p>

    <pre>
# Signature Verification Error: the signature on
# securitycheck.jar is invalid because
# the archive did not contain a valid PKCS7 signature.
</pre>

    <p>The path value printed for signed JavaScript is either the value of the
    <code>ID</code> attribute or the <code>src</code> attribute of the tag that supplied the
    script.</p>


    <h3><a name="debughash" id="debughash">Debugging Invalid Signature Errors</a>
    </h3>


    <p>Invalid signature errors occur if the script has changed from when it was signed.
    The most common cause of this problem is that the scripts have been moved from one
    platform to another with a text transfer rather than a binary transfer. Because line
    separator characters can differ from platform to platform, the hash could change from
    when the script was originally signed.</p>


    <h3>"User did not grant privilege" Exception or Unsigned Script Dialog</h3>


    <p>Depending on whether or not you have enabled codebase principals, you see
    different behavior if a script attempts to enable privileges when it isn't signed or
    when its principals have been downgraded due to mixing of signed and unsigned
    scripts.</p>


    <p>If you have not enabled codebase principals and an unsigned script attempts to
    enable privileges, it gets an exception from Java that the "Enable privilege not
    granted". If you did enable codebase principals, you will see a security dialog
    asking for permissions for the unsigned code.</p>
