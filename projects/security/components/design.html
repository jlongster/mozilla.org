<p>Hackers point out that it is vendors, not they, who are responsible
for the gaping holes that permeate so many products. With companies releasing
software as fast as possible, proper security often gets lost in the rush
toward store shelves. 
<q cite="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/990614/archive_001225.htm">As 
complexity increases, the opportunity for vulnerability
increases</q> says Steven Foote, a senior vice president at the Hurwitz Group,
which analyzes strategic business applications. -- U.S. News, <a class="ex-ref" href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/990614/archive_001225.htm">Can

<p>Mozilla will make increasing use of Internet technologies to implement
the browser itself. This has many benefits for modularity, cross-platform
development, and encouraging development by a wider range of people. However,
it also makes the process of ensuring browser security more challenging
because the lines distinguishing the trusted browser from the untrusted
content it displays have become blurred.</p>

<h2><a name="securitymodel">Security Model</a></h2>

<p>Mozilla should support the existing security model for JavaScript in web
content (see <a class="ex-ref" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040621232800/http://developer.netscape.com/docs/manuals/communicator/jssec/index.htm">JavaScript
Security in Communicator 4.x</a>), with the possible exception of
<a href="signed-scripts.html">signed scripts</a>. Any 
<a href="#apis">new APIs</a> accessible from web content
using Java or JavaScript should be reviewed for security.</p>

<p>Unlike Communicator 4.x (or Mozilla classic), Mozilla makes heavy use
of web-style programming to build the browser itself. This is accomplished
by making powerful actions available to JavaScript, and means that the
security model for Mozilla must grow to support two kinds of code: untrusted
web content and trusted browser implementation code.</p>

<p>Eventually we will need a full capabilities system similar to what Java
has reached in Java2. However, given the need to ship quickly, we should
implement a simpler binary trust model. All code used to implement the
browser should be given full privileges, while the privileges of any code
from off the net should be limited as it was in 4.x.</p>

<p>I'm proposing the following limitations to the capabilities of web-based
code:</p>

<ul>
  <li>No web-based XUL</li>
  <li>No direct access to RDF</li>
  <li>Chrome only runs from the local filesystem (i.e., no downloadable chrome,
only installable chrome)</li>
  <li>Limited access to XPConnect components--most components will not be accessible
from web content, and those that are accessible must undergo security review</li>
  <li>No access of web content to the surrounding chrome</li>
</ul>

<p>These limitations serve to make the system simpler and more secure.</p>

<h2><a name="implementation">Implementation</a></h2>

<h3>Distinguishing types of code</h3>

<p>There are two types of code in our security model: web content and browser
implementation code. How do we distinquish the two? The existing JavaScript
codebase contains support for associating a principal with every script
that is evaluated. Then during execution, a stack of principals corresponding
to the stack frame of the executing JavaScript can be retrieved. Thus at
any point security critical code can check to see if it has been called
by script, and if so, whether that script was privileged or not.</p>

<h2><a name="component">Component Security Analysis</a></h2>

<h3><a name="dom">DOM</a></h3>

<p>The DOM should implement the security model from 4.x (at least the unsigned
part). Historically the DOM has been the area with the most public exploits,
so security implementation here will need careful review.
<p>There are several proposals for additions to the 4.x DOM security model.
Researchers from Bell Labs have proposed several new features, most notably
domain-specific policies. There's a similar proposal described and elaborated
in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=858">Bugzilla bug
858</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="xul">XUL</a></h3>

<p>Since XUL is used to implement chrome, it needs access to highly privileged
services. All code in chrome should be trusted, which means that installing
code into chrome is a privileged action. Note that skins don't contain
any code and should be safe to install without any heavy safeguards.</p>

<p>XUL code can interact with web content. However, we must ensure that
web content cannot interact with privileged XUL code. The web content must
live in a sandbox that cannot be breached through prototype chains or by
the JavaScript "caller" property.</p>

<h3><a name="rdf">RDF</a></h3>

<p>Through the sidebar, RDF content can be retrieved directly from untrusted
servers and aggregated with other RDF content. We'll need a filter for
RDF that can remove potentially dangerous pieces like JavaScript event
handlers and link cancellation.</p>

<p>Many RDF data sources reflect security assets. Most obvious is the filesystem,
but others like the chrome registry have security implications as well.
We should prohibit direct access to RDF from untrusted code.</p>

<h3><a name="xpconnect">XPConnect</a></h3>

<p>XPConnect allows JavaScript (and soon Java) to get access to native XPCOM
components that can perform privileged actions. John Bandhauer has implemented
support for restricting which components are visible through XPConnect.
Scripts running from web content should be limited to a small set of components,
each of which is reviewed for security.</p>

<h3><a name="netlib">Netlib and Necko</a></h3>

<p>Currently protocols like "chrome:" and "resource:" are implemented by pluggable
protocol handlers. Any untrusted code will need to have limits on which
protocols it can access. Historically, this has been a source of many exploits
through protocols like "about:" and "javascript:".</p>

<h2><a name="apis">APIs for Review</a></h2>

<h3>New DOM APIs</h3>

<p>Not sure what's here.... joki will help.</p>

<h3>Chrome registry API</h3>

<p>This is an API that allows web pages to request adding XUL files to chrome.</p>
