<h3></a>Introduction</h3>

<p>NSS 3.2 provides improved SSL performance, support for shared libraries, and improved tools support, 
among other goals listed in detail in the <a href="plan_3_2.html">NSS 3.2 Plan</a>. For a list of all the 
functions exported by the NSS 3.2 DLLs, see <a href="ref/nssfunctions.html">NSS 3.2 Public Functions</a>. 
We guarantee that applications using these APIs will be remain compatible with future versions of the 
shared libraries. For information about migrating your code to use the NSS 3.2 DLLs, see <a href="#migration">
Migration from NSS 3.1.1</a>. For an overview of all the NSS 3.2 libraries, see 
<a href="intro.html">Introduction to Network Security Services</a>.
 
<p><a href="index.html">Network Security Services (NSS)</a> is a set of libraries designed to 
support cross-platform development of security-enabled client and server applications. 
These libraries provide the security foundation for a variety of server products from 
<a href="http://www.iplanet.com/products/index.html">iPlanet 
E-Commerce Solutions</a>, including iPlanet Certificate Management System, iPlanet Web Server, 
iPlanet Directory Server, and iPlanet Messaging Server.

<p>The NSS libraries also underlie <a href="../psm">Personal Security Manager (PSM)</a>, 
which performs cryptographic operations on behalf of Netscape Communicator, Netscape 6, 
and other client applications. 

<p>In early 2000, we contributed NSS to the open source community. All the code that we could 
publish was released as NSS 3.0 on mozilla.org. In October of 2000, we released NSS 3.1, a 
complete version of NSS that included support for the RSA algorithm. A major drawback of NSS 3.1 
was that it did not perform as well as NSS 2.83 on some hardware platforms. In December of 2000, 
we released NSS 3.1.1, which fixed several bugs in NSS 3.1, including a bug related to prime 
number generation.

<p>NSS 3.2  is dual-licensed under the MPL and the GPL.

<p><hr><a NAME="What's"></a>
<h3>Changes Since NSS 3.1.1</h3>
NSS 3.2 supports shared libraries for the first time. For a list of the functions exported by the 
NSS shared libraries (and guaranteed to work with future NSS releases), see 
<a href="ref/nssfunctions.html">NSS 3.2 Public Functions</a>. For information on migrating your code from NSS 3.1.1 
to NSS 3.2, see <a href=#migration">Migration from NSS 3.1.1</a>.

<p>For a list of changes introduced in NSS 3.1.1, see <a href="release_notes_311">NSS 3.1.1 Release Notes</a>.

<p>The sections that follow discuss specific changes in more detail.

<h4> New NSS initialization functions</h4>  
   
NSS 3.2 introduces the mandatory use of the official NSS initialization functions.  

<p>For a long time, NSS had only one official initialization function, 
<a href ="ref/ssl/sslfnc.html#1067601"><tt>NSS_Init</tt></a>.
Many products that used NSS found <tt>NSS_Init</tt> unsuitable for their purposes 
either because (a) it opened the security databases read-only or (b) 
it required applications to put all the security databases into 
a single directory (whose name is supplied by the application), and did not 
allow the application to control the names of the database files in that 
directory.  Those applications often developed their own alternative 
functions for initializing NSS, functions that called NSS private internal 
functions to do their work.  

<p>NSS 3.1 included a new initialization function, 
<a href="ref/ssl/sslfnc.html#1237143"<tt>NSS_InitReadWrite</tt></a>, that allowed the 
application to open the databases read-write, but did not give any more 
flexibility about database file and path names.

<p>NSS 3.2 includes another new initialization function, 
<a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/ident?i=NSS_Initialize"><tt>NSS_Initialize</tt></a>. 
This function provides explicit control over the pathnames and file name prefixes 
for the security databases, as well as control over whether the files are opened
read-only or read-write. This function is not recommended for use by most applications. 
 
<p>The private internal NSS functions that were previously called by applications
that developed their own NSS initialization functions are not exposed in 
the new NSS DSOs and can no longer be called directly by application code.

<p>So, beginning in NSS 3.2, applications MUST use one of the official NSS 
initialization functions.

<h4> New NSS functions for runtime checking of DSO version compatibility</h4>

With NSS packaged in DSOs (or DLLs) instead of being staticly linked into the 
applications, it is now possible for an application to 
be installed with an incompatible version of the NSS DSOs. Therefore, it's desirable 
for an application to be able to test at run time to ensure that 
the NSS DSOs it's using are indeed compatible. To that end, 
NSS 3.2 provides a new function, <tt>NSS_VersionCheck</tt>, that allows the 
application to tell the DSO what version of NSS it was built to use and receive a reply 
indicating whether the DSO is compatible with that version.

<h4>Additional SSL/TLS cipher suites supported</h4>

In NSS 3.2, the cipher suite 
known formally as <tt>SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA</tt> or <tt>TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA</tt> 
is now supported. To maximize compatibility with older programs, unlike 
all the TLS and SSL3 cipher suites that were implemented in older versions 
of NSS, this new cipher suite is NOT enabled by default. 

<p>To use this new cipher suite, an application must enable it explicitly by a call 
to <tt>SSL_CipherPrefSetDefault</tt> or <tt>SSL_CipherPrefSet</tt>. The new cipher suite 
is properly handled by the functions <tt>NSS_SetDomesticPolicy</tt>, 
<tt>NSS_SetExportPolicy</tt>, and <tt>NSS_SetFrancePolicy</tt>. Applications that call 
<tt>SSL_CipherPolicySet</tt> instead of one of the three aforementioned policy functions 
must also call <tt>SSL_CipherPolicySet</tt> for this new policy if they wish to 
use it.

<h4>Use of <tt>SEC_ASN1</tt> templates</h4>

NSS 3.2 provides new macros (#defines) used to access 
<tt>SEC_ASN1</tt> templates that are inside a DLL/DSO from outside of that DSO/DLL.
If you use these macros, your code will work on both NT and UNIX.

<p>There are two parts to the changes.
<ol>
	<li>In any C code (<i>except in</i> initialization data for structures), you 
simply replace the reference to the template with 
<tt>SEC_ASN1_GET(</tt><i>the template</i><tt>)</tt>.<BR><BR>

For example, <BR><BR>

<tt>theTemplate = SEC_IA5StringTemplate;<BR>                                                                     
theTemplate = SEC_ASN1_GET(SEC_IA5StringTemplate);</tt>  <BR><BR>         

	<li>If you have a template of your own that is initialized and whose
initialization data contains a reference to a DSO/DLLs template, then you
must make two changes to your template. You must <tt>OR</tt> the value <tt>SEC_ASN1_XTRN</tt>
into the "kind" member of your template, and you must place the reference
to the external template inside the <tt>SEC_ASN1_SUB()</tt> macro. <BR><BR>

For example:<BR><BR>

<tt>{ SEC_ASN1_SET_OF, <BR>                                                         
offsetof(NSSCMSSignedData,digestAlgorithms), <BR>                         
SECOID_AlgorithmIDTemplate<BR>
}, <BR><BR>                                        
                                                                 

{ SEC_ASN1_SET_OF | SEC_ASN1_XTRN, <BR>                                         
offsetof(NSSCMSSignedData,digestAlgorithms),<BR>                     
SEC_ASN1_SUB(SECOID_AlgorithmIDTemplate) <br>
}, </tt><BR><BR>

</ul> 
 
</ol>

<h4>Deprecated SSL functions no longer available</h4>

As explained in
<a href="ref/nssfunctions.html#dep">NSS 3.2 Public Functions</a>, five old SSL functions 
are deprecated and no longer available in NSS 3.2. The same document lists a new
replacement function for each deprecated function.

<p>One caveat: In NSS 2.7, certain old proprietary Netscape SSL cipher suite
numbers were replaced with new ciphersuite numbers. For
backward binary compatibility, the now-deprecated functions <tt>SSL_SetPolicy</tt> and
<tt>SSL_EnableCipher</tt> automatically substituted the new cipher suite numbers for the
old ones. So, if an application called <tt>SSL_EnableCipher</tt> with the old value for
<tt>SSL_RSA_FIPS_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA</tt> or <tt>SSL_RSA_FIPS_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA</tt>, the
function <tt>SSL_EnableCipher</tt> would substitute the new cipher suite number for the
old one transparently to the application. The new replacement functions,
<tt>SSL_CipherPolicySet</tt> and <tt>SSL_CipherPrefSetDefault</tt> do not perform this automatic
substitution. However, applications compiled with the NSS 3.2 header files
will get the new numbers from the header files and will not require the 
automatic substitution.  So this will not be a problem for applications that
are compiled with the NSS 3.2 headers.  

<p>Use of Netscape's proprietary FIPS cipher suites is now discouraged. 
Applications that want FIPS compliance should now use TLS instead of SSL3.  

<h4>New dependence on <tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt> for 32-bit Solaris applications, and 
on <tt>SHLIB_PATH</tt> for 32-bit HP-UX applications</h4>

For applications on Solaris and HP-UX that use each platform's 32-bit ABI, 
NSS 3.2 now dynamically loads one or more DLLs at run time. NSS 3.2 relies
on those DLLs being in the path specified by the <tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt> environment
variable on Solaris, or by the <tt>SHLIB_PATH</tt> environment variable on HPUX.
If you are developing 32-bit applications on Solaris and HPUX, make sure that all
NSS and NSPR DSOs are installed in the same directory and that the name
of that directory is in the appropriate environment variable.


<p><hr><a NAME="migration"></a>
<h3>Migration from NSS 3.1.1</h3>
 
NSS 3.2 has three shared libraries:
NSS base (<tt>nss</tt>), S/MIME (<tt>smime</tt>), and SSL (<tt>ssl</tt>).  These
shared libraries replace the static NSS libraries as follows:

<ul>
	<li> NSS base:
	<ul> 		
		<li>On Unix, <tt>libnss3.so</tt> replaces <tt>libnss.a</tt>,
    <tt>libcerthi.a</tt>, <tt>libpk11wrap.a</tt>, <tt>libcryptohi.a</tt>, <tt>libsoftoken.a</tt>,
    <tt>libcertdb.a</tt>, <tt>libcrypto.a</tt>, <tt>libfreebl.a</tt>, <tt>libsecutil.a</tt>,
    and <tt>libdbm.a</tt>.
		<li>On Windows, <tt>nss3.lib</tt> (the import library) replaces
    <tt>nss.lib</tt>, <tt>certhi.lib</tt>, <tt>cryptohi.lib</tt>, <tt>pk11wrap.lib</tt>,
    <tt>certdb.lib</tt>, <tt>softoken.lib</tt>, <tt>crypto.lib</tt>, <tt>freebl.lib</tt>,
    <tt>secutil.lib</tt>, and <tt>dbm.lib</tt> (the static libraries).
	</ul>
	
	<li>S/MIME:
	<ul>
		<li>On Unix</tt>, <tt>libsmime3.so</tt> replaces <tt>libsmime.a</tt>, <tt>libpkcs12.a</tt>, 
and <tt>libpkcs7.a</tt>.
		<li>On Windows,  <tt>smime3.lib</tt> (the import library) replaces
     <tt>smime.lib</tt>, <tt>pkcs12.lib</tt>, and <tt>pkcs7.lib</tt> (the static libraries).
	</ul>
	<li>SSL:
	<ul>
		<li>On Unix, <tt>libssl3.so</tt> replaces <tt>libssl.a</tt>.
		<li>On Windows,  <tt>ssl3.lib</tt> (the import library) replaces  <tt>ssl.lib</tt> (the static library).
	</ul>
</ul>

Note the following:
<ul>
	<li>The shared libraries export fewer functions than
   the corresponding static libraries. However, all the
   functions exported by the shared libraries will be
   supported by future NSS 3.x releases.

	<li>PSM won't be able to use the shared libraries in NSS
   3.2 because some of the NSS internal functions used
   by PSM won't be exported by the shared libraries.
   We plan to address this issue soon (in NSS 3.3 or 3.4).

	<li>Similarly, JSS won't be able to use the shared libraries
   in NSS 3.2. We will address this issue in NSS 3.3.

	<li>Shared library linking order:  Both the S/MIME and SSL
   shared libraries depend on the NSS base shared library.
   When we build the S/MIME and SSL shared libraries, we
   already link them with the NSS base shared library to
   resolve symbols.  Therefore, linking order of the shared
   libraries is not important.  For example, on Unix, if
   your code calls both the SSL functions and NSS base
   functions, you can link with either <tt>-lssl3 -lnss3</tt> or
   <tt>-lnss3 -lssl3</tt>, but we recommend the <tt>-lssl3 -lnss3</tt> order
   as a matter of style.

	<li>On Solaris and HP-UX, we also include two shared objects
   (<tt>libfreebl_pure32_3.so</tt> and <tt>libfreebl_hybrid_3.so</tt>) that
   applications do not link with directly but are dynamically
   loaded at run time when NSS is initialized. These two
   shared objects need to be placed in a directory on the
   shared library search path for the applications (e.g.,
   as specified by <tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt> or <tt>HP-UX's SHLIB_PATH</tt>). 
   They contain code specific to the processor architecture
   that improves performance.
</ul>

<p>NSS has not yet been formally tested or certified on any other platforms. 
If you have successfully run NSS on other platforms, or if you are interested 
in taking responsibility for testing and maintaining NSS on a particular platform 
that's not listed above, post a message to 
<A HREF="news://news.mozilla.org/mozilla.dev.tech.crypto">mozilla.dev.tech.crypto</A>.

<p><b>Note re NT builds:</b> The build listed in the left column above as the "NT" build
runs on NT (including Windows 2000) only and hence can potentially
take advantage of some Win32 functions that are only
implemented on NT, such as fibers and I/O completion
ports. The build listed above as the "Windows" build 
runs on all Windows flavors -- 95, 98, Me, NT, and
2000.

<p>Only NSPR makes use of this NT vs.
Windows distinction and provides different NT
and Windows builds. Many Netscape products,
including NSS, have NT and Windows builds that
are essentially the same except one difference:
one is linked with the NT version of NSPR and
the other is linked with the Windows version of
NSPR.


<p><b>Note to Macintosh Developers:</b> Due to a lack of resources, our team was unable to develop 
NSS for the Macintosh platform.  We are looking for help from any interested parties to modify the 
Macintosh project file for NSS 3.2. For contact information, please see the <a href="#feedback">Feedback</a> section.

<h3>Known Bugs and Issues</h3>

<ul>
<li>NSS 3.2 uses mozilla/dbm, which is based on Berkeley DB 1.85. 
Berkeley DB 1.85 is released under the original BSD license, whose "advertising clause" is incompatible with the GNU GPL.
<br><br>In a letter dated July 22, 1999, UC Berkeley announced that the advertising clause is deleted from all the BSD Unix files (of any version of BSD) containing it.  (The announcement is available at <a href="ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/ucb/4bsd/README.Impt.License.Change">ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/ucb/4bsd/README.Impt.License.Change.)</a>  The final (AT&T proprietary) 4.4BSD release contained version 1.6 of Berkeley DB.  The 4.4BSD-Lite2 release contained version 1.74 of Berkeley DB.  Since Berkeley DB 1.85 is not technically in any version of BSD (although it is derived from the Berkeley DB files in 4.4BSD and 4.4BSD-Lite2), it is not clear whether the Berkeley announcement deletes the advertising clause from Berkeley DB 1.85.<br><br>
