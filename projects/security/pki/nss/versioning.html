  <p>NSS has traditionally contained a set of pre-trusted root certificates
  provided by a few root certificate authorities. These authorities and the
  basic trust information can be seen in the Communicator Security Advisor
  (click on the lock), under "Certificates / Signers."</p>

  <p>Some companies consider their certificates "proprietary software," so we
  had to sanitize out their roots and replace them with a couple sample
  certificates to illustrate how the code works. See the file <code class=
  "filename">lib/cert/certinit.c</code>.</p>

  <p>In the original codebase, all certificate and trust information is kept in
  the certificate database (e.g., "cert7.db"; <a href="db_formats.html">the
  physical format of the certificate database is described and available</a>).
  Upon NSS initialization, this database would be created or updated with the
  built-in information. (This information proved much more dynamic than
  originally expected; in the future, we wish to move this basic trust info to
  one or more specific "data-only" PKCS#11 modules: see the code in
  <code class="filename">lib/ckfw/builtins/</code>).</p>

  <p>The code that creates or updates the database is in <code class=
  "filename">lib/cert/certinit.c.</code> Specifically, "CERT_InitCertDB"
  creates a new database, and "CERT_AddNewCerts" updates the database when a
  new version of the client is run with an old database.</p>

  <p>The certificates are stored in base64 form in static char arrays. The
  array "initialcerts" provides instructions on updating a database. This is an
  array of structures with the following format:</p>

  <pre class="code">
typedef struct {
    char *cert;
    char *nickname;
    CERTCertTrust trust;
    int updateVersion;
    certUpdateOp op;
    CERTCertTrust trustDelta;
} certInitEntry;
</pre>

  <p>The cert field points to the base64-encoded cert. The nickname contains
  the text name that appears in the security advisor. The trust field contains
  the basic trust bits for the three subjects of SSL, S/MIME, and object
  signing. Usually three flags have to be set: CERTDB_VALID_CA,
  CERTDB_TRUSTED_CA, and CERTDB_NS_TRUSTED_CA. (These flags are defined in
  <code class="filename">lib/cert/certdb.h</code>). The update version is the
  content version number at which this entry appeared. The code's version is
  CERT_DB_CONTENT_VERSION in certdb.h. The op is the update operation to
  perform, usually certUpdateAdd or certUpdateAddTrust. Finally, the trustDelta
  field is used for some update operations.</p>

  <p>When the database is being updated, <code>CERT_AddNewCerts</code> loops
  through the initialcerts array. Any entry with an updateVersion greater than
  the ContentVersion field in the database is acted upon. The
  <code>certUpdateOp</code> operations are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><code class="command">certUpdateNone</code><br>
    This is a no-op.</li>

    <li><code class="command">certUpdateAdd</code><br>
    The cert is added to the database, with the trust information as specified
    in "trust."</li>

    <li><code class="command">certUpdateDelete</code><br>
    The cert is deleted from the database. I don't think we've ever used
    this.</li>

    <li><code class="command">certUpdateAddTrust</code><br>
    If the cert exists, the trust bits in "trustDelta" are OR'ed into the trust
    info stored in the database. In addition to allowing the root CA vendors to
    change their mind, this allowed us to add the "step-up" bit to roots when
    the vendors received export clearance to issue "step-up" certs. ("Step-up"
    certs are ones which let export-grade clients use strong crypto.)</li>

    <li><code class="command">certUpdateRemoveTrust</code><br>
    If the cert exists, the trust bits in "trustDelta" are removed from the
    trust info stored in the database. This allows root CA vendors to change
    their mind.</li>

    <li><code class="command">certUpdateSetTrust</code><br>
    If the cert exists, the trust info stored in the database is set to be the
    value in "trustDelta." This also allows root CA vendors to change their
    mind.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Example</h2>

  <p>As an example, let us suppose that the first version of the NSS code
  contained two root CA certificates from Example.com: one for server certs,
  and one for individual certs. Originally, they wanted the first to be trusted
  for SSL server authentication, and the second for s/mime and object signing.
  The first version of the code would look like this:</p>

  <p>In certdb.h: <code>#define CERT_DB_CONTENT_VERSION 1</code></p>

  <p>In certinit.c:</p>

  <pre class="code">
static char example_com_server_ca[] = "....";
static char example_com_individual_ca[] = "....";
static certInitEntry initialcerts[] = {
    {
        example_com_server_ca,
        "Example.com Server CA",
        { DEFAULT_TRUST_FLAGS, 0, 0 },
        1,
        certUpdateAdd,
        { 0, 0, 0 }
    },
    {
        example_com_individual_ca,
        "Example.com Individual CA",
        { 0, DEFAULT_TRUST_FLAGS, DEFAULT_TRUST_FLAGS },
        1,
        certUpdateAdd,
        { 0, 0, 0 }
    }
};
</pre>

  <p>Then let us suppose that Example.com received export approval to issue
  step-up server certs, and they also decided that they'd prefer to have a
  third root specifically for object signing. The next version of the code
  might look like this:</p>

  <p>In certdb.h: <code>#define CERT_DB_CONTENT_VERSION 2</code></p>

  <p>In certinit.c:</p>

  <pre class="code">
static char example_com_server_ca[] = "....";
static char example_com_individual_ca[] = "....";
static char example_com_objsign_ca[] = "....";
static certInitEntry initialcerts[] = {
    {
        example_com_server_ca,
        "Example.com Server CA",
        { DEFAULT_TRUST_FLAGS | CERTDB_GOVT_APPROVED_CA, 0, 0 },
        1,
        certUpdateAdd,
        { 0, 0, 0 }
    },
    {
        example_com_server_ca,
        "Example.com Server CA",
        { DEFAULT_TRUST_FLAGS | CERTDB_GOVT_APPROVED_CA, 0, 0 },
        2,
        certUpdateAddTrust, 
        { CERTDB_GOVT_APPROVED_CA, 0, 0 }
    },
    {
        example_com_individual_ca,
        "Example.com Individual CA",
        { 0, DEFAULT_TRUST_FLAGS, 0 },
        1,
        certUpdateAdd,
        { 0, 0, 0 }
    },
    {
        example_com_individual_ca,
        "Example.com Individual CA",
        { 0, DEFAULT_TRUST_FLAGS, 0 },
        2,
        certUpdateRemoveTrust,
        { 0, 0, DEFAULT_TRUST_FLAGS }
    },
    {
        example_com_objsign_ca,
        "Example.com Code Signing CA",
        { 0, 0, DEFAULT_TRUST_FLAGS },
        2,
        certUpdateAdd,
        { 0, 0, 0 }
    }
};
</pre>

  <h2>One dimensional</h2>

  <p>This scheme -- which admittedly grew over time -- worked when there was a
  one-dimensional sequence of the Netscape client products. Unfortunately, this
  scheme is not going to work if NSS is used in multiple divergent clients. In
  particular, we're afraid someone will write a program based on NSS, add their
  own root cert to their code (incrementing the database content version
  number) and release that program. Anyone else who makes a program with a
  similarly-numbered change (including future versions of Netscape, iPlanet, or
  mozilla.org programs) would find that their root trust information would not
  update properly. The only way this would work is if we all coordinated
  database content version numbers, which I don't think will be workable,
  especially in the long run.</p>

  <h2>Going forward</h2>

  <p>Luckily, we had already been planning on moving to a better system. We
  would like to move all sources of data -- the local database, ldap servers,
  these builtins, etc. -- to "data-only" PKCS#11 modules. This is in fact why
  we wrote the "Cryptoki Framework" in lib/ckfw. Different products could
  release small modules with their own trusted roots, and users could install
  any number of these from various sources.</p>

  <p>We have defined a PKCS#11 "trust object" definition. The current code does
  not yet make use of "trust objects," but adding that soon will allow the code
  to use these external data modules even before the databases are
  replaced.</p>
