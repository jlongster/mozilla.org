<h3></a>Introduction</h3>

<p>NSS 3.2.1 provides improved SSL performance and fixes bugs in <tt>pk12util</tt> and some certificate query operations. It also facilitates simplified build instructions; for details, see <A HREF="buildnss_32.html">Build Instructions for NSS 3.2.1 Release</A>.

<p>This document describes the NSS 3.2.1 release only. For detailed information about NSS 3.2, including changes since NSS 3.1.1, see <A HREF="release_notes_32.html">NSS 3.2 Release Notes</A>.

 
<p><a href="index.html">Network Security Services (NSS)</a> is a set of libraries designed to 
support cross-platform development of security-enabled client and server applications. 
These libraries provide the security foundation for a variety of server products from 
<a href="http://www.iplanet.com/products/index.html">iPlanet 
E-Commerce Solutions</a>, including iPlanet Certificate Management System, iPlanet Web Server, 
iPlanet Directory Server, and iPlanet Messaging Server.

<p>The NSS libraries also underlie <a href="../psm">Personal Security Manager (PSM)</a>, 
which performs cryptographic operations on behalf of Netscape Communicator, Netscape 6, 
and other client applications. 

<p>In early 2000, we contributed NSS to the open source community. All the code that we could 
publish was released as NSS 3.0 on mozilla.org. In October of 2000, we released NSS 3.1, a 
complete version of NSS that included support for the RSA algorithm. A major drawback of NSS 3.1 
was that it did not perform as well as NSS 2.83 on some hardware platforms. In December of 2000, 
we released NSS 3.1.1, which fixed several bugs in NSS 3.1, including a bug related to prime 
number generation. 

<p>In March of 2001 we released NSS 3.2, which provided improved SSL performance, support for shared libraries, and improved tools support.

<p>NSS 3.2.1  is dual-licensed under the MPL and the GPL.

<h3>Changes Since NSS 3.2</h3>

<p>NSS 3.2.1 provides improved SSL performance compared with NSS 3.2 and fixes bugs in <tt>pk12util</tt> and some certificate query operations. It also facilitates simplified build instructions; for details, see <A HREF="buildnss_32.html">Build Instructions for NSS 3.2.1 Release</A>.

<p>For changes introduced in NSS 3.2, see <A HREF="release_notes_32.html">NSS 3.2 Release Notes</A>.

<p><hr><a NAME="platforms"></a>
<h3>Platform Information</h3>
NSS is maintained on the platforms listed below. "Certified" means the iPlanet NSS team has built 
and run QA tests for NSS on a machine with the specified OS.

<p>
<p>NSS has not yet been formally tested or certified on any other platforms. 
If you have successfully run NSS on other platforms, or if you are interested 
in taking responsibility for testing and maintaining NSS on a particular platform 
that's not listed above, post a message to 
<A HREF="news://news.mozilla.org/mozilla.dev.tech.crypto">mozilla.dev.tech.crypto</A>.

<p><b>Note re NT builds:</b> The build listed in the left column above as the "NT" build
runs on NT (including Windows 2000) only and hence can potentially
take advantage of some Win32 functions that are only
implemented on NT, such as fibers and I/O completion
ports. The build listed above as the "Windows" build 
runs on all Windows flavors -- 95, 98, Me, NT, and
2000.

<p>Only NSPR makes use of this NT vs.
Windows distinction and provides different NT
and Windows builds. Many Netscape products,
including NSS, have NT and Windows builds that
are essentially the same except one difference:
one is linked with the NT version of NSPR and
the other is linked with the Windows version of
NSPR.


<p><b>Note to Macintosh Developers:</b> Due to a lack of resources, our team was unable to develop 
NSS for the Macintosh platform.  We are looking for help from any interested parties to modify the 
Macintosh project file for NSS 3.2. For contact information, please see the <a href="#feedback">Feedback</a> section.



<p><hr><a NAME="issues"></a>
<h3>Known Bugs and Issues</h3>

<ul>
<li>The NT version of the <tt>pk12util</tt> command does not create a valid PKCS #12 export file on Windows 2000 if the target file is on a networked file system. The workaround for WIndows 2000 is either to (1)write the pkcs12 file to a local file system or (2) use the Windows 95 version of <tt>pk12util</tt>.<BR><BR>


<li>NSS 3.2 uses <tt>mozilla/dbm</tt>, which is based on Berkeley DB 1.85. 
Berkeley DB 1.85 is released under the original BSD license, whose "advertising clause" is incompatible with the GNU GPL.
<br><br>In a letter dated July 22, 1999, UC Berkeley announced that the advertising clause is deleted from all the BSD Unix files (of any version of BSD) containing it. (The announcement is available at <a href="ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/ucb/4bsd/README.Impt.License.Change">ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/ucb/4bsd/README.Impt.License.Change.)</a>  The final (AT&T proprietary) 4.4BSD release contained version 1.6 of Berkeley DB.  The 4.4BSD-Lite2 release contained version 1.74 of Berkeley DB.  Since Berkeley DB 1.85 is not technically in any version of BSD (although it is derived from the Berkeley DB files in 4.4BSD and 4.4BSD-Lite2), it is not clear whether the Berkeley announcement deletes the advertising clause from Berkeley DB 1.85.<br><br>

<li>For a list of reported bugs that have not been fixed in NSS 3.2, 
<a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&chfieldto=Now&product=NSS&cmdtype=doit&namedcmd=all+open+NSS+bugs&newqueryname=&order=Bug+Number">click here.</a> 
(Note that not all of these bugs have been confirmed. Even some bugs in the "new" state are unconfirmed.)

<p><hr><a NAME="compatibility"></a>
<h3>Compatibility</h3>

NSS 3.2.1 is binary compatible with NSS 3.2. The source is backward compatible with NSS 3.1.1, NSS 3.1, and NSS 3.0.x. Applications that restrict their use of NSS APIs 
to the functions listed in <a href="ref/nssfunctions.html">NSS 3.2 Public Functions</a> will remain compatible with 
future versions of the NSS shared libraries.
