<h2> How to use the NSS ASN.1 and QuickDER decoders</h2>
</center>
</div>
<h3> NSS Technical Note: 1</h3>
<span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"> NSS 3.6 contains several decoders
for ASN.1 and DER.Two of them are extensively used and are part of the
public NSS API : </span>
<ol style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">
  <li> The "classic" ASN.1 decoder, written by Lisa Repka . This was
written to be a generic decoder, that includes both DER (Distinguished
Encoding Rules) and BER (Basic Encoding Rules).  It handles both
streaming and non-streaming input.</li>
  <li> The "QuickDER" decoder, written by Julien Pierre for NSS 3.6 .
This decoder was written when performance issues were discovered with
the classic decoder. It can only decode DER .  It does not handle
streaming input, and requires that all input be present before beginning
to decode.</li>
</ol>
<span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"> Despite their differences, the two
decoders have a lot in common. QuickDER was written to be as compatible
as possible with the classic decoder, in order to ease migration to it
in areas of critical performance bottlenecks. For this reason, I will
first describe all the common functionality of the two decoders, before
outlining their differences. </span>
<p style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">The main non-streaming APIs for these
two decoders have an identical prototype : </p>
<ul style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">
  <li> <tt><font size="-1">SECStatus SEC_ASN1DecodeItem(PRArenaPool
*pool, void *dest, const SEC_ASN1Template *t, SECItem *item);</font></tt></li>
  <li> <tt><font size="-1">SECStatus
SEC_QuickDERDecodeItem(PRArenaPool* arena, void* dest, const
SEC_ASN1Template* templateEntry, SECItem* src);</font></tt></li>
</ul>
<span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Here is a description of the
arguments : </span>
<ul style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">
  <li> <tt><u>SECItem* src</u></tt>  is a structure containing a
pointer to the binary data to be decoded, as well as its size.</li>
  <li> <tt><u>const SEC_ASN1Template* templateEntry</u> </tt>is a
pointer to one or more <a href="#Templates">decoder templates</a>. The
number of required templates is determined by the type of the first
template.When multiple templates are required, the pointer must point to
a NULL-terminated array of templates. The syntax of these templates is
identical for both decoders, except where noted. <font style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">A "<tt>NULL</tt> Template" is a template
that is all zeros, having a zero kind.  The term "<tt>NULL</tt>-terminated
array", as used throughout this document, means an array of templates,
the last of which is a <tt>NULL</tt> template.</font></li>
  <li> <tt><u>void* dest</u> </tt>is a pointer to the target area. This
is where the decoder stores its output. The type is undefined as it is
completely dependent on the content of the decoder templates.  This
typically points to a struct that is described (or partially described)
by the templates.</li>
  <li> <tt><u>PRArenaPool* arena</u> </tt>is a pointer to an NSPR arena
pool. This is the arena pool from which the decoder will allocate memory
as needed.</li>
</ul>
<a name="Templates" style="color: rgb(0,0,0); text-decoration: underline;"></a><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); text-decoration: underline;">Decoder
templates :</span><br style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">
<span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><br>
The SEC_ASN1Template structure tells the decoder what to do with the
input data. This structure contains four fields : </span>
<ul style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">
  <li> <tt><u>kind</u></tt> . This 32-bit field tells the decoder what
to do with a particular component within the input data. It is made of
two parts : the lower byte, which can contain <a href="#ASN.1_tags">ASN.1
tags</a>, and the upper 3 bytes, which can contain <a href="#decoder_modifiers">decoder modifiers</a>. If only an ASN.1 tag
is specified without a modifier, then the decoder will enforce the
presence of a component of that type, and fail if it does not match. If
kind is an ASN.1 <tt>SEQUENCE</tt> tag (<tt>SEC_ASN1_SEQUENCE</tt>),
then you must specify additional templates in a NULL-terminated array to
define the content of the of the ASN.1 <tt>SEQUENCE</tt>. If kind is
the <tt>SEC_ASN1_CHOICE</tt> modifier, you must also specify additional
templates in a NULL terminated array to list the various possible types
that this component can have. In all other cases, only the first
template structure passed to the decoder will be considered, even if
additonal templates are passed in an array. When only one template is
needed, you do not need a NULL template to terminate the array.</li>
  <li> <tt><u>offset</u></tt>  . This field does not apply to all
template types. It is only needed if the template instructs the decoder
to save some data, such as for primitive component types, or for some
modifiers where noted.When needed, it tells the decoder where in the
target data to save the current component. It is normally relative to
the <tt>dest</tt> argument passed to the decoder. If templates are
nested, the offset applies to the location of the current component
within the target component, typically the decoded <tt>SEQUENCE</tt>.</li>
  <li> <tt><u>sub</u></tt>  . This field does not apply to all
template types. If <tt>kind</tt> contains the <tt>SEC_ASN1_INLINE</tt>
or <tt>SEC_ASN1_POINTER</tt> modifiers, then it must point to the
required subtemplate. If <tt>kind</tt> contains the <tt>SEC_ASN1_XTRN</tt>
or <tt>SEC_ASN1_DYNAMIC</tt> modifiers, this is a pointer to a callback
function that will dynamically return the required subtemplate.</li>
  <li> <tt><u>size</u></tt>  . This field does not apply to all
template types. It is only required for dynamically allocating memory
for the structure if the template is being included from an ASN.1 <tt>SEQUENCE</tt>
or <tt>SEQUENCE OF</tt>, or if dynamic allocation was requested from
the parent template using the <tt>SEC_ASN1_POINTER</tt> modifier</li>
</ul>
<span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"> Here is a description of the various
tags and modifiers that apply to the </span><tt style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">kind</tt><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"> field. </span>
<p style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><u><a name="ASN.1_tags"></a>ASN.1 tags</u> </p>
<p style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">ASN.1 tags are specified in the lower
byte of the <tt>kind</tt> field of the template, as noted above. <br>
The following is not an attempt to explain ASN.1 tags or their
purposes. Rather, the goal here is to explain what type of tags the
decoder supports and which macros should be used when defining tags in
decoder templates. It should be noted that we only support an older
specification of ASN.1; multibyte tags are not currently supported. </p>
<p style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">The 8-bit ASN.1 tags that we support
are made of three parts : </p>
<ol style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">
  <li> The <font style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">ASN.1 component</font>
class type. It is specified in the upper 2 tag bits (number 6 and 7).
There are four classes of ASN.1 tags : universal, application-specific,
context-specific, and private. You can specify the class of the tag
using the macros <tt>SEC_ASN1_UNIVERSAL, SEC_ASN1_APPLICATION,
SEC_ASN1_CONTEXT_SPECIFIC</tt> and <tt>SEC_ASN1_PRIVATE</tt>. Universal
is the default tag class and does not have to be specified, as the value
of the class type is zero.</li>
  <li> The method type : whether the component type is constructed or
primitive. This information is stored in the next lowest tag bit (number
5). You can use the macro <tt>SEC_ASN1_CONSTRUCTED</tt> for a
constructed component type. A <tt>SEC_ASN1_PRIMITIVE</tt> macro is also
provided, but does not need to be included as it is zero.</li>
  <li> The tag number. It is stored in the lower 5 tag bits (number 0
through 4). The ASN.1 standard only defines tag numbers in the universal
class. If you you are using a tag of a different classes, you can define
your own tag number macros or specify the tag value within the template
definition. The following macros are provided for tag numbers within
the universal class :</li>
  <br>
  <tt>SEC_ASN1_BOOLEAN, SEC_ASN1_INTEGER, SEC_ASN1_BIT_STRING,
SEC_ASN1_OCTET_STRING, SEC_ASN1_NULL, SEC_ASN1_OBJECT_ID,
SEC_ASN1_OBJECT_DESCRIPTOR,  SEC_ASN1_REAL, SEC_ASN1_ENUMERATED,
SEC_ASN1_EMBEDDED_PDV, SEC_ASN1_UTF8_STRING, SEC_ASN1_SEQUENCE,
SEC_ASN1_SET, SEC_ASN1_NUMERIC_STRING, SEC_ASN1_PRINTABLE_STRING,
SEC_ASN1_T61_STRING, SEC_ASN1_TELETEX_STRING, SEC_ASN1_T61_STRING,
SEC_ASN1_VIDEOTEX_STRING, SEC_ASN1_IA5_STRING, SEC_ASN1_UTC_TIME,
SEC_ASN1_GENERALIZED_TIME, SEC_ASN1_GRAPHIC_STRING,
SEC_ASN1_VISIBLE_STRING, SEC_ASN1_GENERAL_STRING,
SEC_ASN1_UNIVERSAL_STRING, SEC_ASN1_BMP_STRING</tt>
  <p>Note that for <tt>SEC_ASN1_SET</tt> and <tt>SEC_ASN1_SEQUENCE</tt>
types, you must also include the method type macro <tt>SEC_ASN1_CONSTRUCTED</tt>
to construct a fully valid tag, as defined by the ASN.1 standard .</p>
</ol>
<u style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><a name="decoder_modifiers"></a>Decoder
modifiers :</u>
<p style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">These modifiers are also specified in
the <tt>kind</tt> field of the template structure. All the values are in
the 9 - 31 bit range. </p>
<ul style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">
  <li> <tt><u>SEC_ASN1_OPTIONAL</u></tt>: tells the decoder that this
component is optional. If the component in the input data does not match
this template, the decoder will continue processing the input data using
the next available template.</li>
  <li> <tt><u>SEC_ASN1_EXPLICIT</u></tt>: tells the decoder that
explicit tagging is being used. This is always a constructed type. It
requires a subtemplate defining the types of the data within.</li>
  <li> <tt><u>SEC_ASN1_ANY</u></tt>: allows the decoder to match this
template with any component type, regardless of the tag in the input
data. If used in conjunction with <tt>SEC_ASN1_OPTIONAL</tt> as part of
a sequence, this must be the last template in the template array.</li>
  <li> <tt><u>SEC_ASN1_INLINE</u></tt>: recurse into the specified
subtemplate to continue processing. This is typically used for <tt>SEC_ASN1_SEQUENCE</tt>
or <tt>SEC_ASN1_CHOICE</tt> definitions, which always need to be the
first template in a template array of their own.</li>
  <li> <tt><u>SEC_ASN1_POINTER</u></tt>: similar to <tt>SEC_ASN1_INLINE</tt>,
except<font style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"> that</font> the memory in the
target will be allocated dynamically<font style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">
and a pointer to the dynamically allocated memory will be stored in the <i>dest</i>
struct at the <i>offset</i>.</font> This requires that the subtemplate
contains a non-zero <tt>size</tt> field.</li>
  <li> <tt><u>SEC_ASN1_GROUP</u></tt>: can only be used in conjunction
with a <tt>SEC_ASN1_SET</tt> or <tt>SEC_ASN1_SEQUENCE</tt>. It tells
the decoder that the component is an ASN.1 <tt>SET OF</tt> or <tt>SEQUENCE
OF</tt> respectively. You can also use the macros <tt>SEC_ASN1_SET_OF</tt>
and <tt>SEC_ASN1_SEQUENCE_OF</tt> which define both the tag number and
this modifier (but still need the method type, this may be a bug).</li>
  <li> <tt><u>SEC_ASN1_DYNAMIC</u></tt> or <tt><u>SEC_ASN1_XTRN</u></tt>
: specifies that the component format is defined in a dynamic
subtemplate. There is no difference between the two macros. The <tt>sub</tt>
field of the template points to a callback function of type <tt>SEC_ASN1TemplateChooser</tt>
that returns the subtemplate depending on the component data.</li>
  <li> <tt><u>SEC_ASN1_SKIP</u></tt>: specifies that the decoder should
skip decoding of the component. <tt>SEC_ASN1DecodeItem</tt> can only
skip required components and will assert if you try to skip an <tt>OPTIONAL</tt>
component. <tt>SEC_QuickDERDecodeItem</tt> supports skipping the
decoding of <tt>OPTIONAL</tt> components if you define the tag of the
component in the template</li>
  <li> <tt><u>SEC_ASN1_INNER</u></tt>: recurse into the component and
saves its content, without the surrounding ASN.1 tag and length</li>
  <li> <tt><u>SEC_ASN1_SAVE</u></tt>: saves the component data, but
does not proceed to the next component if within a <tt>SEQUENCE</tt>
template array. This means the next template will reprocess the same
component.</li>
  <li> <tt><u>SEC_ASN1_SKIP_REST</u></tt>: abort the decoding. This is
used in a template array within a <tt>SEQUENCE</tt>, if you don't care
about the fields at the end of it. <tt>SEC_ASN1DecodeItem</tt> only
supports this modifier in the top-level template. <tt>SEC_QuickDERDecodeItem</tt>
allows it at any nested sublevel.</li>
  <li> <tt><u>SEC_ASN1_CHOICE</u></tt>: allows decoding of components
that are of variable type. This must be the first template in a
NULL-terminated array. The <tt>offset</tt> parameter specifies where to
store the type identifier in the target data . Subsequent templates
specify a custom identifier for each possible component type in the <tt>size</tt>
parameter .</li>
  <li> <tt><u>SEC_ASN1_DEBUG_BREAK</u></tt>: makes the decoder assert
when processing the template. This option is only supported with <tt>SEC_QuickDERDecodeItem</tt>
. It is useful to debug your templates or when writing new templates if
they don't work.</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><br>
<u>Differences between <tt>SEC_ASN1DecodeItem</tt> and <tt>SEC_QuickDERDecodeItem</tt></u> </p>
<ol style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">
  <li> The <tt>arena</tt> argument is required to be non-<tt>NULL</tt>
for <tt>SEC_QuickDERDecodeItem</tt> . With <tt>SEC_ASN1DecodeItem</tt>,
it can be <tt>NULL</tt>, and if so, the decoder will allocate from the
heap using <tt>PR_Malloc</tt> . However, this usage is strongly
discouraged and we recommend that you always use an arena pool even with <tt>SEC_ASN1DecodeItem</tt>.
See <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=175163">bug
175163</a> for more information about the reason for this recommendation.</li>
  <li> <tt>SEC_ASN1DecodeItem</tt> will make a copy of the input data
into the decoded target as needed, while <tt>SEC_QuickDERDecodeItem</tt>
will generate output with pointers into the input. This means that if
you use <tt>SEC_QuickDERDecodeItem</tt>, you must always be careful not
to free the input as long as you intend to use the decoded structure.
Ideally, you should allocate the input data out of the same arena that
you are passing to the decoder. This will allow you to free both the
input data and the decoded data at once when freeing the arena.</li>
  <li> <tt>SEC_ASN1DecodeItem</tt> can decode both BER and DER data,
while <tt>SEC_QuickDERDecodeItem</tt> can only decode DER data.</li>
  <li> <tt>SEC_QuickDERDecodeItem</tt> does not support streaming data.
This feature will most likely never be added, as this decoder gets most
of its extra speed from not making a copy of the input data, which would
be required when streaming.</li>
  <li> <tt>SEC_QuickDERDecodeItem</tt> supports <tt>SEC_ASN1_OPTIONAL</tt>
together with <tt>SEC_ASN1_SKIP</tt></li>
  <li> <tt>SEC_ASN1_DEBUG_BREAK</tt> is not supported by <tt>SEC_ASN1DecodeItem</tt></li>
