FIPS 140-2 <a href="#Reference_1">[1]</a> is a US Federal standard
that specifies
the security requirements for cryptographic modules. Cryptographic
modules can be validated to FIPS 140-2 at Security Levels 1, 2, 3, and
4. Security Level 2 or higher has audit requirements that must be met
with the audit mechanism of the OS.<br>
<br>
This document summarizes the audit requirements in FIPS 140-2 in the
hope that it will help cryptographic module developers seeking FIPS
140-2 validation at Security Level 2 or higher, and OS developers
working on auditing.
<h2>Terms and Definitions</h2>
FIPS 140-2 and the Derived Test Requirements (DTR) for FIPS 140-2 <a
 href="#Reference_2">[2]</a> use the following audit-related terms
without definitions. Hopefully people working on auditing know
what these terms mean.<br>
<ul>
  <li>auditable events</li>
  <li>audited events</li>
  <li>audit data</li>
  <li>audit functions</li>
  <li>audit mechanism</li>
  <li>audit trail</li>
  <li>audit log</li>
  <li>auditing capability (of the cryptographic module)</li>
  <li>audit capabilities (of the OS)</li>
</ul>
The following terms are defined in FIPS 140-2 and are essential to
understanding its audit requirements.<br>
<br>
<a name="CSP"></a><span style="font-style: italic;">Critical security
parameter (CSP)</span>: security-related
information whose disclosure or modification can compromise the
security of a cryptographic module. Examples include:<br>
<ul>
  <li>secret and private cryptographic keys (public keys are not
considered CSPs)</li>
  <li>authentication data such as passwords and PINs</li>
  <li>audited
events and audit
data</li>
</ul>
An <span style="font-style: italic;"><a name="operator"></a>operator</span>
is an individual (or a process operating on behalf of the individual)
accessing a cryptographic module, regardless of the assumed role.<br>
<br>
A cryptographic module shall support the following authorized <span
 style="font-style: italic;">roles</span> for operators:<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">User Role</span>: the role
assumed to perform general security services, including cryptographic
operations and other security functions.</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;"><a name="Crypto_Officer_Role"></a>Crypto
Officer Role</span>: the role assumed to perform <span
 style="font-style: italic;">cryptographic initialization</span> or <span
 style="font-style: italic;">management</span> functions (e.g., <span
 style="font-style: italic;">module initialization</span>, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">input/output of cryptographic keys and CSPs</span>,
and <span style="font-style: italic;">audit functions</span>). Note:
it's not clear what <span style="font-style: italic;">management</span>
means here. It seems to mean module
management (Sec. 4.10.4 on p. 38):
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Crypto
officer guidance</span> is concerned with the correct configuration,
maintenance, and administration of
the cryptographic module.<br>
</div>
but it may (also) mean <a
 href="#key_management">key management</a> (Sec. 4.4 on p. 19):<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">A cryptographic module shall include
the following operational and error states:<br>
...<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Crypto officer states</span>. States
in which the crypto officer services are performed (e.g., cryptographic
initialization and key management).<br>
</div></li>
</ul>
A <span style="font-style: italic;"><a name="crypto_officer_function"></a>crypto
officer function</span> is a
duty or activity assigned to the crypto officer role. Crypto officer
functions include:<br>
<ul>
  <li>cryptographic module initialization: this includes <span
 style="font-style: italic;">initializing the authentication mechanisms</span>
the first time the module is accessed.</li>
  <li>input/output of cryptographic keys and other CSPs</li>
  <li>audit functions</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-style: italic;"><a name="authentication_data"></a>Authentication
data</span> include passwords, PINs, and biometric data.<br>
<br>
<a name="key_management"></a><span style="font-style: italic;">Key
management</span> mechanisms: random number and key generation, key
establishment, key distribution, key entry/outpout, key storage, and
key zeroization.<br>
<h2>Requirements on the OS</h2>
FIPS 140-2 has four Security Levels: 1, 2, 3, and 4. Security Level 1
only requires a basic operating system, so we omit it for brevity.
Security Levels 2 and higher require that the OS be <a
 href="#Common_Criteria_Evaluation_of_the_OS">Common Criteria
certified</a>, have an <a href="#Audit_Mechanism_of_the_OS">audit
mechanism</a>, and have discretionary access
control that must be used to <a href="#Protection_of_Audit_Data">protect
audit data</a>. We delve into each of
these requirements next.<br>
<h3><a name="Common_Criteria_Evaluation_of_the_OS"></a>Common Criteria
Evaluation of the OS</h3>
Security Levels 2 and higher have the following requirements on the OS
(from FIPS 140-2, Table 1, on p. 12 and Sec. 4.6.1 on pp. 28-30):<br>
<ul>
  <li>Security Level 2: any of the approved protection profiles (PPs)
evaluated at EAL2 with specified discretionary access control
mechanisms and <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">auditing</span>.</li>
  <li>Security Level 3: any of the approved PPs plus trusted path
(FTP_TRP.1) evaluated at EAL3 plus security policy modeling (ADV_SPM.1).</li>
  <li>Security Level 4: any of the approved PPs plus trusted path
evaluated at EAL4.</li>
</ul>
where the approved PPs are (from FIPS 140-2 Annex B):<br>
<ul>
  <li>Controlled Access Protection Profile (CAPP), Version 1.d,
Protection Profile NoPP006, 8 October 1999.</li>
  <li>Protection Profile for Single-Level Operating Systems in
Environments Requiring Medium Robustness, Version 1.22, 23 May 2001.</li>
</ul>
Note that in Security Level 2, 3, or 4, an equivalent evaluated trusted
OS may be used instead of the above.
<h3><a name="Audit_Mechanism_of_the_OS"></a>Audit Mechanism of the OS</h3>
FIPS 140-2 says the OS must provide an audit mechanism to record
modifications, accesses, deletions, and additions of cryptographic data
(cryptographic keys and audit data) and CSPs.
<h3><a name="Protection_of_Audit_Data"></a>Protection of Audit Data</h3>
FIPS 140-2 (Sec. 4.1 on p. 14) considers audited events and audit data
as <a href="#CSP">critical information</a> whose disclosure or
modification can compromise the security of the cryptographic module.<br>
<br>
Audited events and audit data must be protected by configuring the
discretionary access control mechanisms of the OS to:<br>
<ul>
  <li>specify the <span style="font-style: italic;">roles</span> that
can <span style="font-style: italic;">modify</span> (i.e., write,
replace, and delete) audit data</li>
  <li>specify the <span style="font-style: italic;">roles</span> that
can <span style="font-style: italic;">read</span> audit data</li>
</ul>
Note that FIPS 140-2 says audit data are stored within the
cryptographic boundary.<br>
<h4>Discussions</h4>
In the Medium Robustness (MR) PP, only authorized administrators (not
to be confused with the cryptographic administrators in MR) can modify
or read audit data.
<h2>Requirements on Audited and Auditable Events</h2>
<h3>Security Level 2</h3>
The audit requirements of Security Level 2 are as follows.<br>
<br>
The following events shall be recorded by the audit mechanism:<br>
<ul>
  <li>attempts to provide invalid input for <a
 href="#crypto_officer_function">crypto officer functions</a>, and</li>
  <li>the addition or deletion of an <a href="#operator">operator</a>
to/from a <a href="#Crypto_Officer_Role">crypto officer role</a></li>
</ul>
The audit mechanism shall be capable of auditing the following events:<br>
<ul>
  <li>operations to process audit data stored in the audit trail,</li>
  <li>requests to use <a href="#authentication_data">authentication
data</a> management mechanisms,</li>
  <li>use of a security-relevant <a href="#crypto_officer_function">crypto
officer function</a>,</li>
  <li>requests to access user <a href="#authentication_data">authentication
data</a> associated with the cryptographic module</li>
  <li>use of an authentication mechanism (e.g., login) associated with
the cryptographic module</li>
  <li>explicit requests to assume a <a href="#Crypto_Officer_Role">crypto
officer role</a>, and</li>
  <li>the allocation of a function to a <a href="#Crypto_Officer_Role">crypto
officer role</a>. Paraphrase: the assignment of a duty/activity to a
crypto officer role.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Discussions</h4>
A cryptographic module may have its own login that's independent of the
OS login, so that logging into the cryptographic module is orthogonal
to logging into an OS user account or entering an OS role. This means
that the <span style="font-style: italic;">roles</span> (user and
crypto officer) of a cryptographic modules may not be implemented
directly as the <span style="font-style: italic;">roles</span> in the
OS (such as the Crypto Admin role in some OS).<br>
<br>
An OS may have <span style="font-style: italic;">multiple</span>
cryptographic modules, including
<span style="font-style: italic;">third-party</span> cryptographic
modules that are not built into the standard OS. These (third-party)
cryptographic modules need to be able to hook into the audit system of
the OS.
<h3>Security Level 3</h3>
In addition to the audit requirements of Security Level 2, the
following events shall be recorded by the audit mechanism (Sec. 4.6.1
on p. 29):<br>
<ul>
  <li>attempts to use the trusted path function, and</li>
  <li>identification of the initiator and target of a trusted path.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Security Level 4</h3>
Security Level 4 doesn't have additional audit requirements.<br>
