<h2>Audited Events</h2>
<h3>crypto_officer_authentication_failure</h3>
This event type satisfies the FIPS 140-2 requirement that <span
 style="font-style: italic;">attempts to provide invalid input for
crypto officer functions</span> shall be recorded by the audit
mechanism.<br>
<h3>invalid_new_crypto_officer_authentication data</h3>
This event type satisfies the FIPS 140-2 requirement that <span
 style="font-style: italic;">attempts to provide invalid input for
crypto officer functions</span> shall be recorded by the audit
mechanism.<br>
<br>
If the authentication mechanism for the cryptographic module is
passwords, this event is recorded if the crypto officer attempts to set
his initial or new password and the new password is too weak
(e.g., too short) or contains invalid characters.
<h3>invalid_new_cryptographic_module_user_authentication data</h3>
This event type satisfies the FIPS 140-2 requirement that <span
 style="font-style: italic;">attempts to provide invalid input for
crypto officer functions</span> shall be recorded by the audit
mechanism.<br>
<br>
If the authentication mechanism for the cryptographic module is
passwords, this event is recorded if the crypto officer attempts to set
the user's initial or new password and the new password is too weak
(e.g., too short) or contains invalid characters.
<h3>addition_of_user_to_crypto_officer_role</h3>
This event type satisfies the FIPS 140-2 requirement that&nbsp;<span
 style="font-style: italic;">the addition or deletion of an operator
to/from a crypto officer role</span> shall be recorded by the audit
mechanism.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">MR Note</span>: This event type is
closely related to the auditable event "modifications to the group of
users that are part of a role" prompted by the requirement "Security
Roles (FMT_SMR.2)" in MR. FMT_SMR.2.1 requires that the TSF shall
maintain a <span style="font-style: italic;">cryptographic
administrator</span> role.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">libaudit Note</span>: AUDIT_ROLE_ASSIGN<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">NSS Note</span>: This event type does
not apply to the NSS software cryptographic module.
<h3>deletion_of_user_from_crypto_officer_role</h3>
This event type satisfies the FIPS 140-2 requirement that&nbsp;<span
 style="font-style: italic;">the addition or deletion of an operator
to/from a crypto officer role</span> shall be recorded by the audit
mechanism. An alternative is to have an event type that combines this
event and the previous event.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">MR Note</span>: This event type is
closely related to the auditable event "modifications to the group of
users that are part of a role" prompted by the requirement "Security
Roles (FMT_SMR.2" in MR. FMT_SMR.2.1 requires that the TSF shall
maintain a <span style="font-style: italic;">cryptographic
administrator</span> role.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">libaudit Note</span>: AUDIT_ROLE_REMOVE<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">NSS Note</span>: This event type does
not apply to the NSS software cryptographic module.
<h2>Auditable Events</h2>
<h3>cryptographic_module_self_test_failure</h3>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">MR Note</span>: this event type is
closely related to the auditable event
"execution of the cryptography self tests and the results of the tests"
prompted by the requirement "TSF Testing (for cryptography)
(FPT_TST.1(1))" in MR.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">libaudit Note</span>:
AUDIT_ANOM_CRYPTO_FAIL
<h3>cryptographic_module_audit_data_review</h3>
This event type satisfies the FIPS 140-2 requirement that the audit
mechanism shall be capable of auditing <span
 style="font-style: italic;">operations to process audit data stored in
the audit trail</span>.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">NSS Note</span>: This event type does
not apply to the NSS software cryptographic module.
<h3>cryptographic_module_audit_data_search</h3>
This event type satisfies the FIPS 140-2 requirement that the audit
mechanism shall be capable of auditing <span
 style="font-style: italic;">operations to process audit data stored in
the audit trail</span>.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">NSS Note</span>: This event type does
not apply to the NSS software cryptographic module.
<h3>request_to_change_cryptographic_module_authentication_data</h3>
This event type satisfies the FIPS 140-2 requirement that the audit
mechanism shall be capable of auditing <span
 style="font-style: italic;">requests to use authentication data
management mechanisms</span>.<br>
<h3>cryptographic_module_initialization</h3>
<h3>persistent_key_generation</h3>
<h3>persistent_key_import</h3>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">NSS Note</span>: C_UnwrapKey.
C_SetAttributeValue(CKA_TOKEN)
<h3>persistent_key_export</h3>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">NSS Note</span>: C_WrapKey.
C_GetAttributeValue
<h3>persistent_key_deletion</h3>
<h3>cryptographic_module_authentication_attempt</h3>
This event type satisfies the FIPS 140-2 requirement that the audit
mechanism shall be capable of auditing the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">use of an authentication mechanism (e.g.,
login) associated with the cryptographic module</span>.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">MR Note</span>: This event type is
related to the auditable event "all use of the authentication
mechanism" prompted by the requirement "Timing of Authentication
(FIA_UAU.1)" and the auditable event "all re-authentication attempts"
prompted by the requirement "Re-authenticating (FIA_UAU.6)".<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">libaudit Note</span>: add
AUDIT_CRYPTO_AUTH or AUDIT_CRYPTO_LOGIN?<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">NSS Note</span>: This event type is
recorded whenever an operator attempts to log into the NSS software
cryptographic module.
<h3>explicit_request_to_assume_crypto_officer_role</h3>
This event type satisfies the FIPS 140-2 requirement that the audit
mechanism shall be capable of auditing <span
 style="font-style: italic;">explicit requests to assume a crypto
officer role</span>.The wording of this event ("explicit requests to
assume a role") seems to come from Common Criteria. See MR Note below.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">MR Note</span>: This event type is
related to the auditable event "explicit requests to assume a role"
prompted by the requirement "Assuming Roles (FMT_SMR.3)" in MR.
FMT_SMR.3.1 says the TSF shall require an explicit request to assume <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">any role</span>.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">libaudit Note</span>:
AUDIT_USER_ROLE_CHANGE?<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">NSS Note</span>: This event type is
recorded whenever an operator attempts to log into the NSS software
cryptographic module. (In NSS the user role and the crypto officer role
are combined into one role.)
