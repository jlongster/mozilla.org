<h2>A Vulnerability in SSL/TLS implementations of ciphersuites that use block
ciphers</h2>
Recently, Swiss researchers published <a
 href="http://lasecwww.epfl.ch/memo_ssl.shtml">a memo</a> describing a way
to gather information about the data transmitted over an SSL or TLS channel.&nbsp;
In certain circumstances it is possible to use this method to decrypt some
of the data in the messages (such as a password).&nbsp; This vulnerability
is due to the way error handling is implemented in applications that use
the CBC mode ciphers in SSL or TLS.&nbsp; The method works by measuring timing
differences in the way an application reacts to new messages created by an
attacker. At the current time, the implementation of SSL and TLS in NSS library
is susceptible to this method.<br>
 <br>
 A patch for NSS has been developed that corrects this situation.
<a href="../nss-3.4.3/nss-3.4.3-release-notes.html">NSS 3.4.3</a>,
<a href="../nss-3.7.3/nss-3.7.3-release-notes.html">NSS 3.7.3</a>,
and NSS 3.8 or later will contain the patch. Until
updated libraries are available the following action is recommended:<br>
 
<ul>
  <li> Netscape/mozilla browser users do not need to take any action.&nbsp; 
They could choose to disable TLS or disable CBC mode block ciphersuites as
a precaution against vulnerable servers.</li>
  <li>Administrators of servers that are based on NSS 2.8 or later and that
enable TLS need to take action. They could disable TLS or disable CBC mode
block cipher suites.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
 Details<br>
 <br>
 There are several requirements that must be met in order for this vulnerability
to be exploited:<br>
 
<ol>
  <li>The SSL/TLS connection must be using one of the block encryption ciphers
that use CBC mode, such as DES or AES.&nbsp; Channels using stream ciphers
such as RC4 are not subject to the flaw.&nbsp; A large proportion of SSL/TLS
connections use RC4.</li>
  <li>The vulnerability can only be exploited by someone that intercepts
data on the SSL/TLS connection, and also actively sends new data on that
connection.&nbsp; Exploiting the flaw causes the SSL/TLS connection to be
terminated.&nbsp; The attacker must continue to monitor and use new connections
until enough data is gathered to decrypt the message.<br>
   </li>
  <li>Since the connection is terminated each time, the SSL/TLS client must
be willing to keep re-establishing the SSL/TLS channel long enough for the
message to be decrypted.</li>
  <li>The application must resend the same data on each SSL/TLS connection
that it creates and the listener must be able to locate it in the data stream.&nbsp;
Protocols like IMAP/SSL that have a fixed set of messages to login meet this
requirement. General web browsing does not.</li>
</ol>
 In general, there is more risk when a SSL/TLS server (rather than client)
is vulnerable.&nbsp; This is because data such as passwords and cookies are
usually sent from the client to the server.&nbsp; If sensitive data is commonly
sent from server to client (in a predictable way), then the client would
also need to be updated.<br>
 <br>
 The SSL protocol (SSL3) is somewhat more immune to this flaw than is TLS.&nbsp;
As best I can determine, it is theoretically possible (with enough effort)
to decrypt all of the data on a TLS connection.&nbsp; However, it appears
that only partial information can be determined about data on an SSL3 stream.
(I think the best that can be determined is a range of possible values for
one out of every eight bytes.)<br>
 <br>
 This flaw does not reveal either private keys (such as the server's RSA key)
or session keys. It reveals only a selected portion of the data.<br>
 <br>
 There are several actions that can be taken to prevent this flaw, or detect
that someone might be exploiting it.<br>
 
<ol>
  <li>Disable the CBC mode ciphers in&nbsp; SSL and TLS, leaving only the 
RC4 stream cipher enabled.&nbsp; This change is only necessary on servers, 
since both the server and the client must agree on a common ciphersuite.</li>
  <li>Monitor the logs of SSL/TLS servers for an increase in the number of
connections that are terminated because of errors decrypting or verifying
data received on the channel.</li>
  <li>Disable TLS and use only the SSL3 protocol.&nbsp; Again, this change 
is only necessary on servers.&nbsp; This change is not necessary if the CBC 
mode ciphers are disabled.<br>
   </li>
</ol>

<h2>Follow-up: TLS block cipher vulnerability</h2>
This note is a follow up to the note that I wrote yesterday evening.&nbsp;
I'd like to describe specific circumstances where exposure the TLS vulnerability
is the highest, and review the actions that can be taken to reduce or eliminate
the risk.<br>
 <br>
 First, this vulnerability is primarily in applications that use TLS, rather
than SSL version 3.<br>
 <br>
 In order to be vulnerable, the application using the TLS connection must
retransmit the same data each time the channel is established. For example,
a protocol that sends a password or cookie to a server each time it creates
a new TLS connection might be at risk.&nbsp; It must be possible for someone
to observe each of these TLS connections, and record the encrypted data that
corresponds to the password or cookie.&nbsp; Finally, the application must
re-establish the TLS connection (and resend the secret data) each time the
channel is closed or on a regular schedule.<br>
 <br>
 Examples<br>
 <br>
 A good example of an application (and protocol) that meets these requirements
is IMAP running over TLS.&nbsp; Each time a mail client establishes a TLS
connection to the mail server, it sends and receives a predictable set of
messages.&nbsp; One of these messages will be a LOGIN command, which provides
the user name and password for the account.&nbsp; It is fairly easy to record
the particular (encrypted) message that corresponds to the LOGIN command.&nbsp;
Also, most mail clients can be configured to check for new mail every few
minutes, so new connections will be created on a regular basis.<br>
 <br>
 A second example might be a web site which uses HTTP basic authentication
over TLS, and is set up to automatically refresh the content of the page
on a regular basis.&nbsp; The basic authentication password will generally
be found at the same position in the HTTP request, so the encrypted value
can be recorded by the observer.&nbsp; Again, the application will periodically
recreate the TLS connection and resend the secret data in order to get the
new page contents.<br>
 <br>
 If we assume that these clients check for new data every minute, in 24 hours
1440 TLS connections will be made. Researchers have been able to recover
password data in as little as 160 attempts (for badly chosen passwords).&nbsp;
More difficult passwords take from 1200 to 4000 attempts on average.<br>
 <br>
 What to do<br>
 <br>
 Users of clients such as Netscape 7 or Mozilla do not need to do anything.&nbsp;
Since passwords are generally sent from the client to the server, a flaw
in the server is needed to expose the data. If they wish, users can disable
TLS (but not SSL3) in the security preferences as additional protection for
unfixed servers.<br>
 <br>
 Administrators of servers that use TLS for applications like those described
above should disable TLS until a corrected version of the server is available.&nbsp;
Servers that do not support TLS (such as servers based on versions of NSS
earlier than 2.8) or do not provide a way to enable TLS do not need to take
any action.&nbsp; All servers should leave SSL3 enabled.<br>
 <br>
 (Optional) There is still some (but greatly reduced) risk of this flaw when
using the SSL v3 implementation in NSS version 2.7 and earlier.&nbsp; Administrators
of servers that use these versions of the NSS library can disable the SSL3
ciphersuites that use block ciphers. All the ciphersuites except those that
use the RC4 streaming cipher should be disabled in this case.<br>
