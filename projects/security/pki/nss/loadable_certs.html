<a name="background"><h3>Background</h3></a>

Any PKI deployment must provide a scheme for propagating trust. Until now, the primary mechanism for  
doing so in PKI deployments with Netscape products has been to build root certificates for 
leading certificate authorities (CAs) into the products. 

<p>Unfortunately, an inherent problem with this approach has been the difficulty of upgrading CA 
certificates in the field. In addition, NSS is now open source. Vendors' products may have their own 
requirements for which trusted roots they include. Users may need to run several different products 
with different requirements at the same time.

<p>Finally, some products, like servers, may need to ship without long lists of built-in 
trusted root certificates because these products often operate within their own heirarchy.

<p>For these reasons, we would like to be able to change the built-in trusted root certificates 
on the fly without releasing a new product.

<a name ="changed"><h3>What Has Changed</h3></a>

NSS 3.1 no longer has a compiled-in list of root certificates. If you run NSS 3.1 in such a way as to 
generate a new database, these built-in root certificates do not get copied into the database. 
Instead, a PKCS #11 module is loaded after the database is initialized. The root certificates
and trust information is loaded from this PKCS #11 module. Any trust bits in existing databases 
won't get overridden. Changes in trust get written back to the database, not the PKCS #11 module.

<a name="mycode"><h3>How Does This Affect My Code?</h3></a>

First, you need to make sure this PKCS #11 module gets installed. You can do this one of two ways:

<ul>
	<li>Make sure that the built-in module is installed in the same directory where the key and 
certificate databases live. NSS will find it and install it, looking under the following names:<BR><BR> 
	
	<tt>roots.dll&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;libroots.so&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;libroots.sl<BR>
	nssckbi.dll libnssckbi.so libnssckbi.sl<BR>
	mozckbi.dll libmozckbi.so libmozckbi.sl<BR>
	netckbi.dll libnetckbi.so libnetckbi.sl</tt><BR>	
	<BR>
	or
	<BR><BR>
	<li>Use the <tt>SECMOD_AddNewModule()</tt> call in your application if the built-in module isn't loaded.
</ul>

Next, you need to change any code that displays root certificates to search both the database 
and the PKCS #11 module.

<a name="where"><h3>Where Can I Find the Plug-in Module?</h3></a>

The plug-in is built as part of NSS libraries under <tt>dist/${OBJDIR}/lib</tt> and is called one of the following:

<tt><pre>
	 ttlibnssckbi.so
	 nssckbi.dll
	 libnssckbi.sl
</pre></tt>

<a name="sampleinstall"><h3>Sample code for installing the module</h3></a>
	

<tt><pre>
	 /*
	 * initialize NSS as normal....
	 */


	/*
	 * check to see if you have a rootcert module installed
	 */

	hasroot = PR_FALSE;
	list = PK11_GetAllTokens(CK_INVALID_MECH,PR_FALSE,PR_FALSE, &pwdata);
	if (list) for (le->list->head; le; le->next) {
	   if (PK11_HasRootCerts(le->slot) {
		hasroot = PR_TRUE;
		break;
	   }
	}

	if (!hasroot) {
		dll_path = yourFindrootCertModuleInYourInstallTree();
		SECMOD_AddNewModule("Root Certs",dll_path, 0, 0);
	}

</pre></tt>

<a name="samplegetcerts"><h3>Sample code to get the certs with the module loaded</h3></a>

Change
<pre>
	<tt>rv = CERT_TraversePermCerts(handle, &lt;your_callback&gt;, &numCerts);</tt>
</pre>
to
<pre>
	<tt>list = PK11_GetAllTokens(CK_INVALID_MECH,PR_FALSE,PR_FALSE, &pwdata);
	if (list) for (le = list->head; le; le->next) {
	    rv = PK11_CertsInSlot(le->slot, &lt;your_callback&gt;, &lt;your_params&gt;);
	}
</pre>
