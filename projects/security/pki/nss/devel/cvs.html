When you have a Mozilla CVS account, you need to ask an NSS developer
who is an <span style="font-style: italic;">Owner</span> or <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Peer</span> of the NSS component to give
you CVS commit access to the NSS source tree. He needs to follow these
instructions.<br>
<ul>
  <li>Go to <a href="https://despot.mozilla.org/">https://despot.mozilla.org/</a>
and log in with his CVS account name (his email address, with @ as
opposed %) and CVS password. If he forgets his CVS password, open a bug
report against the product mozilla.org for help.</li>
  <li>In the Despot main menu, click the button "List all the
partitions".</li>
  <li>In the list of partitions, find the partition named "security"
and click the "Edit" button next to it. The "security" partition controls
the trunk of NSS and JSS.</li>
  <li>Add your CVS account name (your email address, with @ as opposed
to %) to either Owner, Peer, or Member.</li>
  <li>Click the "Save changes" button.</li>
  <li>Repeat these steps for the "NSS Stable Release Branch" partition,
which controls the current NSS stable release branch.</li>
</ul>
<h2> When checking in code </h2>
The CVS commit comment must include the following information.<br>
<ul>
  <li>The bug number.</li>
  <li>A <span style="font-style: italic;">concise</span> description
of the checkin. One should be able to understand what the change is
without looking up the bug report.</li>
  <li>The code reviews you received, using the <code>r=reviewer</code>
notation.</li>
  <li>An acknowledgement if the patch was contributed by someone
outside
the team</li>
  <li>List of files modified.</li>
</ul>
<h2> Update the Bug </h2>
<ul>
  <li> Include the CVS output in the bug report. This provides a way to
tie a specific version back to the code. </li>
</ul>
