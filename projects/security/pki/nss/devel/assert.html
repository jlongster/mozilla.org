<span style="font-weight: bold;">[DRAFT. NOT FINAL.]</span><br>
<br>
This is a policy statement about two closely related topics: assertions
and invalid argument (such as null pointer) checking.<br>
<br>
Our policy on
asserts had the following components:
<br>
<br>
1. For every assertion, there must be code that follows it that
avoids a crash for the asserted condition in the "optimized" builds.
<br>
<br>
2. Assertions should catch programming errors that occur <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">inside NSS</span> itself, but not in
external callers.&nbsp; NSS should return error codes
to external callers, not crash when they err.&nbsp;&nbsp; But NSS
should assert
the correctness of its own internal callers.
<br>
<br>
3. Assertions should not be
used to catch erroneous data being passed in.&nbsp; That is, erroneous
data should cause error codes, not crashes, even in debug code.
This
only applies to functions that return an indication of success. This
applies to external functions, not internal ones.<br>
