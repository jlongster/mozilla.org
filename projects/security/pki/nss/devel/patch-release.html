<h2>Definition: What's a Patch Release? </h2>
The version number of an NSS release has three components: x.y.z. The
first component x is the major version, the second component y is the
minor version, and the third component z is the patch level. An NSS
patch release x.y.z is an NSS release with a nonzero patch level z. Its
purpose is to fix critical bugs in the NSS x.y release.<br>
<br>
In general, the NSS x.y.z patch releases are created from the
NSS_x_y_BRANCH branch in our CVS repository. This document describes
the policy that applies to the checkins on these patch release branches<br>
<h2>What is Allowed in a Patch Release? </h2>
People generally agree that a patch release should only contain
critical bug fixes, but people disagree in what is a critical bug.
Occasionally we have to implement urgent new features in a patch
release to avoid bumping the minor version. &nbsp;Finally, our
customers expect that a patch release is extremely stable and
some of them even expressed the opinion that they don't want bug fixes
that are irrelevent to them. Our policy will address these issues.<br>
<h4>Critical Bug Fixes</h4>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Security vulnerability</span>
fixes: every customer wants these bug fixes.</li>
  <li>Fixes for <span style="font-weight: bold;">bugs introduced in an
earlier patch release</span>.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Build system</span> changes:
these are useful to open source projects such as the Mozilla clients
that need to build NSS from source code. They sometimes need changes to
our build system to fix build issues or support new compilers.</li>
  <li>Other critical bug fixes: <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">crashes, severe memory leaks, data loss or
corruption, severe loss of functionality, etc.</span>
In a patch release, we should only fix those bugs that actually affect
customers and cannot be worked around.
We must set the bar for this category very high and
resist the perfectionist tendency. Many of our customers assess the risk
of a patch release by the length of the bug fix list or the size of the
source code diffs. Let's not make them want to "cherry pick".</li>
</ul>
<h4>New Features</h4>
New features should only be allowed under the following conditions:<br>
<ul>
  <li>The customer requesting the new feature can't upgrade to the next
NSS minor release, for example, because of schedule constraints,
stability concerns, or OS policy (if NSS is a system library).</li>
  <li>The new feature must be coded in a way so that it's easy to
verify that no existing functions are modified.</li>
  <li>The next NSS minor release hasn't been released.</li>
</ul>
