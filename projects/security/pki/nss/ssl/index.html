<P>NSS implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) v2 and v3 and Transport Layer Security 
(TLS) protocols. This page summarizes information about the SSL/TLS module within NSS.

<p>The SSL protocol allows mutual authentication between a client and server and the
establishment of an authenticated and encrypted connection. SSL runs above TCP/IP and below HTTP,
LDAP, IMAP, NNTP, and other high-level network protocols. It was originally invented by Netscape 
and has become a de facto Internet standard. For the SSL 3.0 specification (also called SSL v3) in plain text form, see <a href="draft302.txt">
The SSL Protocol, Version 3.0</a>. For the original SSL 0.2 specification (also called SSL v2), see 
<a href="draft02.html">The SSL 0.2 Specification</a>.

<p><b>Note re version numbers:</b> Both SSL2 and SSL3 have 16-bit
(two-byte) version number fields. SSL2 interprets this as a single
16-bit integer, and the official number is 2, e.g. 0x0002.  SSL3 
interprets two-byte version numbers as a one byte "major" number and
a one byte "minor" (or fractional) number.  So the value 0x0002 is 
interpret by SSL3 as version 0.2, not 2.0.


<p>TLS is a protocol from the IETF based on SSL. It will eventually supersede SSL while 
remaining backward-compatible with SSL implementations. For the version 1.0 of the TLS protocol specification, see 
<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2246.txt">The TLS Protocol</A>.

<p>The following documents provide background information that you need to understand 
before attempting to work with the SSL/TLS APIs provided by NSS:
<ul>
    <li><A HREF="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/Introduction_to_Public-Key_Cryptography">
Introduction to Public-Key Cryptography</A>. Explains the basic concepts of public-key 
cryptography that underlie NSS.
    <li><A HREF="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/Introduction_to_SSL">
Introduction to SSL</A>. Introduces the SSL protocol, including information about 
cryptographic ciphers supported by SSL and the steps involved in the SSL handshake. 
</ul>
