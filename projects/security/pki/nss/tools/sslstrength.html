<H3>
Summary</H3>
A simple command-line client which connects to an SSL-server, and reports
back the encryption cipher and strength used.
<H3>
Synopsis</H3>
<TT>1) sslstrength ciphers</TT>
<P><TT>2) sslstrength hostname[:port] [ciphers=xyz] [debug] [verbose] [policy=export|domestic]</TT><TT></TT>
<H3>
Description</H3>
The first form simple lists out the possible ciphers. The letter in the
first column of the output is used to identify the cipher preferences in
the ciphers=&nbsp; command.
<P>The second form attempts to connect to the named ssl host. The hostname
argument must be present. However, the port number is an optional argument,
and if not given, will default to the https port (443).
<H4>
Restricting Ciphers</H4>
By default, sslstrength assumes that all the preferences are on, so it
will use any preferences in your policy. The enabled ciphersuites will
always be printed out before the connection is made. If you want to test
out a particular cipher, there are two ways to affect which ciphers are
available. Firstly, you can set <B><TT>policy</TT></B> to be either domestic
or export. This restricts the available ciphers to the same set used by
Communicator. In addition to this, the <B><TT>ciphers</TT></B> command
can be used to further restrict the ciphers available. The argument to
the ciphers command is a string of characters, where each single character
represents a cipher. You can obtain this list of character->cipher mappings
by doing 'sslstrength ciphers'. For example,
<P><B><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ciphers=bfi</TT></B> will turn on these cipher
preferences and turn off all others.
<P><B><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; policy=export</TT></B> or <B><TT>policy=domestic</TT></B>
will set your policies appropriately.
<P><B><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; policy</TT></B> will default to domestic if not specified.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H4>
Step-up</H4>
Step up is a mode where the connection starts out with 40-bit encryption,
but due to a 'change-cipher-spec' handshake, changes to 128-bit encryption.
This is only done in 'export mode', with servers with a special certificate.
You can tell if you stepped-up, because the output will says 'using export
policy', and you'll find the secret key size was 128-bits.
<H3>
Prerequisites</H3>
<TT>You should have a cert7.db in the directory in which you run sslstrength.</TT>
