<br>
The NSS 4.0 distribution consists of five shared libraries.  Three of those
libraries implement the API available to all NSS applications:
<br>
<ol>
  <li>SSL - implementation of the SSLv2, SSLv3, and TLS protocols.</li>
  <li>S/MIME - CMSv3 and PKCS#12</li>
  <li>NSS core - cryptographic routines, PKCS#11 module management, core PKI
      functions, ASN.1</li>
</ol>
In order to provide some flexibility in certificate definitions and crypto
implementations, NSS defines two pluggable interfaces.  The first is the
certificate framework.  This framework allows NSS to implement basic
certificate functions, such as path construction and validation, without
being dependent on a given certificate definition.  In addition, the 
certificate framework includes a revocation API, so that applications may 
implement a specific revocation model.<br>
<br>
The second framework used by NSS is PKCS #11.  This standard API allows 
NSS to store and retrieve objects, generate keys, and perform cryptographic 
operations on devices such as smart cards and hardware accelerators.<br>
<br>
The NSS distribution includes implementations of the two frameworks 
described above.  The first is the PKIX library, which implements the
certificate framework for X.509 certificates (though applications may choose
to define specific revocation functionality).  The second is the software 
PKCS #11 module, which provides a software implementation of the PKCS #11 
API.<br>

<!-- Overview -->
<hr width="100%" size="2">
<h3><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</h3>

What follows is an overview of what a running process may look like at the
NSS level. NSS relies heavily on the PKCS #11 standard as a means of
providing flexibility at the lowest level of cryptographic functionality.
If you are not familiar with PKCS #11, you should read this document
(XXX).
<br>
<br>
NSS maintains a set of PKCS #11 modules that are globally visible (that is,
available to all trust domains). Events that change the state of these
modules may affect ongoing operations. For example, authenticating to
a token shared between two trust domains will cause its objects to be visible
to both trust domains. (XXX sanity check - is that correct? don't see
how it couldn't be...)
<br>
<br>
<img src="global.gif" alt="pkcs11 modules" width="630" height="351">
<br>
<br>
Here are some of the key aspects:
<br>
<ol>
  <li><i>global module list</i> - PKCS#11 modules are loaded and unloaded
      through and API that affects all trust domains. A module's tokens may
      be shared between trust domains, as shown above.
  </li>
  <li><i>trust domain</i> - a trust domain is a collection of tokens selected
      from the global module list. It can use the tokens for crypto operations
      and for storing objects. The trust domain contains a unique trust value
      for each certificate in it; that is, the actual trust is specific to the 
      trust domain.
  </li>
  <li><i>volatile domain</i> - a temporary facility for storing ephemeral
      objects. Volatile domains are created from trust domains. Objects 
      within them have a limited lifetime; they go away when the volatile
      domain goes away (unlike trust domain objects, which are persistent).
  </li>
  <li><i>crypto context</i> - a temporary facility for performing single- 
      and multi-part cryptographic operations.
  </li>
</ol>
In the diagram shown above, two trust domains share a set of three modules.
The first trust domain includes a particular slot from the softoken,
the second includes a different slot. Thus, while they are sharing
the same module, they are using different tokens, and the certificates and
private keys of one trust domain will not be visible to the other. Both
trust domains share a module containing trusted root certificates, though
they may choose to override that trust independently. Finally, both
trust domains share a hardware accelerator module.
<br>
<br>
There are a number of configuration options that determine how a module's
tokens will behave in a trust domain. These include:
<br>
<ul>
  <li>ordering - applications can set relative preference for which modules
      should perform certain operations
    <ul>
      <li>crypto - a token may be preferred over other tokens for performing
          crypto operations.
      </li>
      <li>cert - a token may be preferred for storing certificates.
      </li>
      <li>others?
      </li>
    </ul>
  <li>others?
  </li>
</ul>
The initialization process for NSS consists of loading and configuring a set
of modules. XXX need to describe in detail, along with how to init a
trust domain
<br>
<br>

<!-- Trust Domains -->

<hr width="100%" size="2"><br>
<h3><a name="Trust_Domains"></a>Trust Domains</h3>

Trust Domains are the field in which certificates are validated. In
PKI, certificates bind public keys to a name (identity? XXX). The validity of this
binding depends on trust: does the user trust the certificate for the chosen
operation? The answer to that question depends on the environment,
one user may trust the certificate directly, another may trust one of the
certificates in its chain, and another may not trust the certificate at
all.
<br>

<img src="trust.gif" alt="trust" width="351" height="237" align="left">In
the diagram to the left, two trust domains are active in a single NSS process.
Each trust domain represents an SSL server running in the process. 
The trust domains share a common token. However, the trust domains 
independently assign trust to certificates, so even though both domains 
contain certificate X, www.bar.com chooses to trust it while www.foo.com 
does not.<br>
</td></tr></table>
<br>
From an application's perspective, trust domains are a collection of PKI
objects: certificates, CRLs, public keys, private keys, symmetric keys, 
and S/MIME profiles. In addition, trust domains include trust information
for certificates.<br>
<br>
These objects are kept in persistent storage. When this storage is a PKCS #11
device, the object is stored by whatever mechanism is available on the
device. A smart card may keep them in a removable medium. A hardware 
accelerator may have physical storage. For some objects (non-user peer certs, 
CRLs, etc.) this storage is in a database local to the trust domain and 
managed by NSS.  From an application's perspective, these differences may 
be ignored, as the application simply interacts with the trust domain 
(though often the application has some control over what tokens perform
certain operations).<br>
<br>
Trust domains are initialized with a set of tokens. Tokens may be added
or removed from the trust domain at any time. All objects from a trust
domain's tokens are automatically visible to it, unless they are private
objects, in which case authentication may be required first.<br>
<br>
<img src="trustdomain.gif" alt="trust domain" width="601" height="476">
<br>
<br>
<br>
Features of a trust domain
<br>
<ol>
  <li><i>slot list</i> - a trust domain consists of a set of tokens. This
      set is kept in a slot list. The reason for storing slots is that a
      token may be made temporarily unavailable (e.g., by being removed), but 
      a slot persists until the module is unloaded. When a search for objects
      is performed in a trust domain, it iterates over the slots, obtains the 
      active tokens, and then (effectively) searches those tokens.
  </li>
  <li><i>token interface</i> - tokens may be shared between trust domains;
      the interface is the trust domains entry point to the actual token.
  </li>
  <li><i>trust database</i> - the primary function of a trust domain is to
      manage certificate trust. Certs may appear on multiple tokens
      in the trust domain, in this case their trust values are merged. A 
      certificate may be trusted in one trust domain, but not another. To the 
      user, the effect is that a trust domain appears to have a database of 
      trust for each certificate in it, and that database can be modified 
      without affecting other trust domains, and without concern for where the 
      trust is actually stored.
  </li>
  <li><i>certificate cache</i> - certificate searches in the trust domain
      are cached, both to improve search times and to avoid redundant 
      decodings.
  </li>
</ol>
<br>
The diagram is simplified; it only shows a trust domain responding to a 
certificate query (including looking up the trust of the certificate), and 
peforming RSA operations. Trust domains are actually capable of handling any 
type of PKI object and any crypto operation supported by NSS.
<br>
<br>
The diagram also shows some features that are outside of trust domains, but
that interact with them. First, the <i>token cache</i> is used for tokens
whose response time to queries is long. For such tokens, all public
objects are loaded when the token is activated, and the attributes of the
objects are stored in the cache. Further queries to the token are handled
by the cache. This cache is outside of trust domains, and thus shared
between them.
<br>
<br>
<i>Crypto contexts</i> (not shown) can be created from trust domains, and used
 for various cryptographic operations. In this example, a crypto context 
has been created to perform RSA operations, using a hardware accelerator token.
<br>
<br>
<i>Volatile domains</i> (not shown) can be created from trust domains, 
and used to manage temporary objects.  Volatile domains behave in much 
the same way as trust domains, except that they manage temporary objects.
<br>
<br>

<!-- Volatile Domains -->

<hr width="100%" size="2">
<h3><a name="Volatile_Domains"></a>Volatile Domains</h3>

Volatile domains are like a "snapshot" of the trust domain.  As noted in the
<a href="#Interfaces">interfaces</a> section, volatile domains and trust 
domains inherit the same interface.   However, objects generated within 
volatile domains are temporary, and will have the same lifetime as the domain. 
This makes volatile domains a convenient place to store objects for short-term 
operations, such as building a signed message.
<br>
<br>
<img src="volatiledomain.gif" alt="crypto context" align="bottom">
<br>
Features of a volatile domain:
<br>
<ul>
  <li><i>temporary store</i> - each volatile domain contains a private
      store of temporary objects used by the domain.  Certs are
      stored within the domain itself.  Keys are stored as handles to
      the corresponding PKCS#11 session objects.  From a user perspective,
      there is no difference between the two storage methods.
      <br>
      However, there is some special behavior related to trusted certs.
      When a temporary cert (one residing in a volatile domain) is marked
      as trusted, it is moved into the parent trust domain.  Thus all
      trusted temporary certs are visible to all volatile domains.  This
      follows from the notion of a trust domain as a place to manage trust.
  </li>
  <li><i>session</i> - a volatile domain may need to create temporary objects
      on a PKCS#11 token, for example, an RSA key pair for ephemeral RSA.
      Such objects are created as session objects on the token, and managed
      by the volatile domain.  The volatile domain will maintain a session
      on each token for which it has session objects, and when it is destroyed
      it will destroy the session objects as well.
  </li>
</ul>
<br>

<!-- Crypto Contexts -->
<hr width="100%" size="2">
<h3><a name="Crypto_Contexts"></a>Crypto Contexts</h3>

Crypto contexts are designed for a single cryptographic operation. One
context may perform MD5 hashing, while another contains a private key that
can generate signatures. Internally, the context maintains a PKCS #11
session for a particular token, and a number of objects that are accessible
by the session. Once a context is established, it must be used only
for the intended operation; it cannot be switched to a new operation. However,
there is some performance gain in reusing sessions, so there are some instances
where context reuse is allowed:
<br>
<ul>
  <li>The context has just completed a single-part or multi-part operation.
      It may be reused for the same operation. If a key is involved
      (e.g., multi-part encryption), the same key will be used, and a new 
      IV may be supplied through the parameters.
  </li>

  <li>If the context contains a certificate, it may be used for public key
      operations. If the certificate is a user certificate, it may also be
      used for private key operations.
  </li>
</ul>
Contexts also maintain state in multi-part operations. This state can be saved 
and restored. Contexts can be cloned as well. In general, contexts are much 
more flexible and efficient than their object-based counterparts 
(<tt>NSSCryptoContext_Encrypt</tt> vs. <tt>NSSSymKey_Encrypt</tt>).

<img src="cryptocontext.gif" alt="crypto context" align="left">
Features of a crypto context:
<br>
<ol>
  <li><i>distinguished object</i> - a crypto context may work with a single
      object at a time, for example a symmetric key used for encryption.
  </li>
  <li><i>session</i> - the operations performed by the context occur within
      a single PKCS#11 session for a specific token.
  </li>
  <li><i>operation state</i> - The context has a state which can be saved,
      restored, and cloned.
  </li>
</ol>
Related volatile domain features:
<br>
<ol>
  <li><i>temporary store</i> - A context may be created from a volatile
      domain, giving it access to the domain's temporary objects.  
      This may include certs stored in the volatile domain, or temporary 
      keys created on a PKCS#11 token (as session objects) and managed by 
      the volatile domain.
  </li>
</ol>
Related trust domain features:
<br>
<ol>
  <li><i>token interface</i> - Contexts have access to the tokens of the
      trust domain from which they were created, and hence may use token 
      objects (such as a token private key).

<!-- Interfaces -->

<hr width="100%" size="2">

<h3><a name="Interfaces"></a>Interfaces</h3>
<br>
The following outline lists the APIs provided by the NSS 4.0 core library.
Some conventions are followed:
<ol>
  <li>When a function argument name ends in "Opt", the argument is optional.
      A default behavior will be followed if the argument is not provided.
  </li>
  <li>Functions that return arrays always return NULL-terminated arrays.</li>
  <li>All NSS types, except for NSSItem, are opaque and thus allocated
      on the heap.  Most constructors (<tt>Create()</tt> methods) allow for 
      this allocation to occur within an arena.  All types have a 
      destructor of the form <tt>NSSType_Destroy(NSSType *t)</tt> that
      <b>must</b> be used to free the memory used by the struct.  It is safe
      to call the destructor even when the type was allocated within an
      arena.
  </li>
  <li>Combining (1) and (3), any function that takes an arenaOpt argument
      will allocate memory for return values from arenaOpt if it is not
      NULL and from the heap if it is NULL.
  </li>
  <li>In the interface documents linked below, some interfaces may be
      implemented by more than one type.  When this occurs, the interface
      will be shown without the type preceding the function name, and a
      generic "<_implementor_>" will be shown as the first argument.  For
      example, this text:<br>
      <br>
      <tt><b>EnableToken</b></tt><br>
      <i>implemented by: NSSTrustDomain, NSSVolatileDomain</i><br>
      Enable the specified token for use within the domain.

      <pre>
  PRStatus
  EnableToken (
    &lt;_implementor_&gt; *imp,
    NSSToken *token
  );
      </pre>
      means that the API includes two functions:

  PRStatus
  NSSTrustDomain_EnableToken (
    NSSTrustDomain *td,

<!-- Certificates -->

<hr width="100%" size="2">
<h3><a name="Certificates"></a>Certificates</h3>

Referring back to the architecture <a href="#Architecture">diagram</a>, 
certificates in the core PKI library are generic. They are not tied to any 
particular specification. The core PKI library does not rely on properties of
a particular certificate definition (though it does generally reflect the
structure of X.509 certificates).<br>
<br>
This flexibility allows NSS to incorporate a new certificate definition without
changes to the PKI component. The implementation of a given certificate
definition is kept within a separate shared library, and is "pluggable".
The plugin is registered at initialization time by declaring what certificate
type it implements.  The plugin must implement a set of methods required by NSS 
to obtain information it needs to carry out PKI operations. An example of 
such a method is one that provides the bytes of the public key from a 
certificate.<br>
<br>
Applications will have both the core PKI API (NSSCert) and the component
certificate API (NSSPKIXCertificate, for one) available to them. At
this time, the only supported certificate type is PKIX (RFC 3280), however,
applications that may wish to support other types in the future should avoid
being tied down to only one type. In most cases, working with the generic
type (NSSCert) is all that is necessary. For UI purposes, applications
may want to display lower-level parts of a certificate, in which case 
they may obtain the component type from the generic types (essentially a 
downcast).<br>
