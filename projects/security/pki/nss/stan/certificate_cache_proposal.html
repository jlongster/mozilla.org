<h2>Stan Certificate Cache Proposal</h2>
    <br>
    In NSS versions prior to NSS 3.4, the certificate "cache" was both a
cache   and a storage facility for temporary certs.&nbsp; The cache consisted
of  an in-memory DBM database.&nbsp; The entries of the database were exactly
 like cert7.db: one matched certificateKey to certificate, the second matched
 subject to set of certificateKeys, the third mapped nickname to subject,
and the last mapped email address to subject.<br>
    <br>
    In order to do a lookup from a high-level index like nickname, one had
 to  walk from nickname to subject to set of certKeys to set of certificates.<br>
    <br>
    In 3.4 and beyond, the certificate cache was split into a proper cache
 and  a certificate store.&nbsp; The store was associated with NSSCryptoContext.&nbsp;
  The cache became a PLHashTable.&nbsp; There four indices remained the same,
  but subject and nickname entries became a list of certificates, and email
  entries became a list of list of certificates (set of matching subjects).<br>
    <br>
    This design makes the assumption that certificate pointers are unique,
and enforces this assumption.&nbsp;   It has the following drawbacks:<br>
    <br>
       
<ol>
      <li>When a cert is stored in the cache, it is propogated to all indices:
  a reference is stored in the issuer/serial, subject, and nickname or email
  address entries.</li>
      <li>Certs stay in the cache until the last reference is freed.&nbsp;
 Then  they leave the cache immediately, though they may be needed again
right  away.&nbsp;  In this sense, the cache is still not a true cache.</li>
      <li>The cache must be explictly kept consistent with token insertion
 and  removal.</li>
      <li>The cache can grow to an unlimited size.<br>
      </li>
       
</ol>
    <br>
    <br>
    Here are design ideas I have heard for the Stan cache:<br>
    <br>
       
<ul>
      <li>It should be a true fixed-size cache, preferably something using
 an  LRU scheme.</li>
      <li>It should cache searches, not just certs.&nbsp; That is, it should
  remember if a search has been performed, and return the result of that
search.&nbsp;   The caller can test whether the reply is up-to-date, and
if so, avoid actually   going out to tokens to perform searches.&nbsp; This
would avoid costly database   lookups for common searches.<br>
      </li>
       
</ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    With that in mind, I propose the following:<br>
    <br>
       
<ol>
      <li>The cache still consists of four mappings.&nbsp; Each of these
mappings   is a separate LRU.&nbsp; The mappings are independent of one another.&nbsp;
  They are:                 
    <ul>
        <li>issuer/serial --&gt; certificate</li>
        <li>subject --&gt; array of certificates</li>
        <li>nickname --&gt; array of certificates</li>
        <li>email --&gt; array of certificates</li>
                   
    </ul>
      By independent, I mean that a cert that was stored in the cache by
 subject will <u>only</u> be stored in the subject cache.<br>
     <br>
   </li>
      <li>What is stored is the result of a search, whether there are any 
certs  or not.&nbsp; In pseudocode:<br>
    <br>
   <code>&nbsp; certs = find_subject_certs_in_cache(cache, subject);<br>
    &nbsp; if (up_to_date(certs)) {<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return certs;<br>
    &nbsp; }<br>
    &nbsp; certs = find_subject_certs_on_tokens(tokens, subject);<br>
    &nbsp; add_subject_certs_to_cache(certs);<br>
    &nbsp; return certs;<br>
    </code><br>
  Even if certs is NULL after the token search, the result is cached.&nbsp;
  The next time the search is performed, the reply comes from the cache.&nbsp;
  No tokens are involved.<br>
     <br>
   </li>
    <li>Cache entries are kept "up-to-date" with respect to token events.&nbsp;
  An entry in the cache can go stale if:        
    <ul>
      <li>a cert is deleted from a token</li>
      <li>a cert is imported to a token</li>
      <li>a token is removed</li>
      <li>a token is inserted</li>
         
    </ul>
    Handling the first two events is straightforward, the cache is notified 
of the event.&nbsp;  Handling the last two events would be done via a series 
counter.&nbsp; Every time  a token is removed or inserted, the series counter 
is incremented.&nbsp; When entries are put into the cache, they are given 
the value of the series counter at the time of the search.&nbsp; The cache's 
response is considered valid as long as that value matches the current counter. 
&nbsp;For a system that uses no removable devices, the series counter would 
always  be 1, and the cache responses would always be correct.<br>
     <br>
   </li>
   <li>Using an LRU scheme means that certificate pointers are no longer
 unique.&nbsp; NSS must no longer rely on this assumption.<br>
       </li>
</ol>
