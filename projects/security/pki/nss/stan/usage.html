                        <br>
 I'm trying to implement cert verification in Stan, and I would like to have
some more discussion about how we define usage. &nbsp;Here's the current
picture,  as I see it:<br>
     
<ol>
  <li>The certificate itself has a set of usages, derived from extension
values and defined in RFC 3280.</li>
  <li>NSS defines a set of usages in SECCertUsage. &nbsp;These usages
essentially  coalesce the intersecting usages from above.<br>
     </li>
  <li>NSS defines additional usages through the trust object, these are once
 again a subset of the above.<br>
    </li>
</ol>
   <br>
   The current working model in Stan is similar to what Julien implemented
 in CERT_VerifyCert. &nbsp;The type NSSUsage is a bitmask of possible
usages.<br>
   <br>
   The problem is that the three definitions of usage listed above do not
all  agree. The trust object has the fields serverAuth and clientAuth, with
possible  values being { not trusted, trusted, trusted delegator }. &nbsp;SECCertUsage
 has only the field certificateUsageSSLCA. &nbsp;If a cert is a trusted delegator
 for clientAuth, but not server auth, would its usage include certificateUsageSSLCA?
 &nbsp;Currently, it does: I called CERT_VerifyCert with a subordinate
CA,  where the root was only trusted for client auth. &nbsp;The usage certificateUsageSSLCA
 is returned as having been validated. &nbsp;While there is nothing functionally
 wrong with this (leaf certificates are verified correctly), I think it is
 a bit confusing.<br>
   <br>
   We want to use trust as a way to allow users to restrict the use of a cert,
 beyond what is specified in its extensions. &nbsp;For example, a cert with
the  usual CA extensions may be only trusted for issuing SSL certs.<br>
   <br>
   I think we would achieve maximum flexibility by defining usage as such:<br>
   <br>
   struct NSSUsages {<br>
   &nbsp; &nbsp; NSSUsage ca;<br>
   &nbsp; &nbsp; NSSUsage leaf;<br>
   };<br>
  <br>
  NSSUsage is a set of bits defined as usual, without the "CA" entries. &nbsp;The
 bitmask in usages-&gt;ca is the set of usages for which the cert may be an
 issuing cert, and the bitmask in usages-&gt;leaf is the set of usages for
 which the cert can actually be used. &nbsp;In general, only one field will
be used for a particular cert, but there is nothing preventing a cert from
being valid as both a CA and a peer (if there were, we could just use a single
bit to represent CA usages).<br>
  <br>
  In addition, I propose that trust is just an NSSUsages. &nbsp;We store
the struct  shown above with the cert, and treat the value as the "set of
trusted usages".  &nbsp;I believe this is a useful merge, after all, our
current trust object has  fields which look like our usage values. &nbsp;If
a new usage is added for which  we want to specify trust, now we have do
it in two places. &nbsp;With this proposal,  the trust object wouldn't have
to change.<br>
 <br>
 As an example, an untrusted cert that has the basicConstraints extension,
with cA = true, and the keyUsage extension, with the bit keyCertSign, would
have an NSSUsages like so:<br>
 <br>
 usages = { ~0, 0 }; /* in other words, valid for all CA usages, and no leaf
usages */<br>
  <br>
 When doing verification, the set of _trusted_ usages will be checked, in
this example they are:<br>
 <br>
 trustedUsages = { 0, 0 }; &nbsp;/* it's not trusted for any use */<br>
 <br>
 If this cert chains to a root where trustedRootUsages = { ~0, 0 }, then the
cert will be a valid intermediate CA cert for any type of leaf. &nbsp;If
trustedRootUsages  = { NSSUsage_SSLClient, 0 }, then the cert will be a valid
intermediate CA  cert for SSL client certs only. &nbsp;If trustedRootUsages
= { NSSUsage_SSLClient  | NSSUsage_SSLServer, 0 }, then the cert will be
a valid intermediate CA cert for SSL client certs and servers.<br>
 <br>
 Applications that do not require this level of granularity could define the
old usages, <br>
 <br>
 NSSUsages sslCA = { NSSUsage_SSLClient | NSSUsage_SSLServer, 0 };<br>
 <br>
 Thoughts?<br>
