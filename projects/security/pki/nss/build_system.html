<h3>

<hr>Background</h3>
<a href="index.html">Network Security Services (NSS)</a> started out as
the base security code used by the original Netscape Navigator products.
In the beginning, this code was packaged and built as part of the monolithic
client build system. The NSS build system was disentangled from the client
build system starting with Communicator. Since then, it has gone through
a series of modifications in response to the changing needs of NSS customers,
whose products now include the following:
<ul>
<li>
Mozilla open source browser and related browser products, including Netscape
browsers.</li>

<li>
<a href="http://www.iplanet.com/products/product_map/product_name_2_0a.html">iPlanet
server products</a>, including but not limited to the following:</li>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.iplanet.com/products/iplanet_directory/home_2_1_1z.html">iPlanet
Directory Server</a></li>

<li>
<a href="http://www.iplanet.com/downloads/developer/">iPlanet LDAP C SDK</a></li>

<li>
<a href="http://www.iplanet.com/products/iplanet_certificate/home_2_1_1ad.html">iPlanet
Certificate Management System</a></li>

<li>
<a href="http://www.iplanet.com/products/iplanet_web_enterprise/home_2_1_1m.html">iPlanet
Web Server</a></li>

<li>
<a href="http://www.iplanet.com/products/iplanet_messaging/home_2_1_1h.html">iPlanet
Messaging Server</a></li>
</ul>

<li>
Custom client-server applications built by other NSS customers.</li>
</ul>
Each of these products includes legacy NSS-dependent code and has specialized
build requirements. We must continue to support them while working toward
the goal of an independent NSS build solution that integrates smoothly
with a modular Mozilla build system.
<p>Beyond the goal of merely building without error on all platforms, the
NSS team has the goal of building efficient, high-performance crypto code
on all platforms. NSS and its current build system contain much embedded
knowledge of how to get optimal performance out of specific compilers on
specific platforms, and of pitfalls (including compiler deficiencies) to
avoid on specific platforms. Code that merely builds correctly on these
platforms may be far from optimal for some NSS customers.
<p>This document describes the history of the NSS build system, iPlanet
and Mozilla requirements for a new build system, and some proposals for
how to meet those requirements. Please send feedback on these proposals
to <a href="news://news.mozilla.org/mozilla.dev.tech.crypto">mozilla.dev.tech.crypto</a>.

<h3>

<hr>Definitions</h3>
This document uses the following terms related to the Netscape, Mozilla,
and NSS build systems:
<p><b>autoconf:</b> A build system framework that is popular in the open
source community.
<p><b>config:</b> The original build system for Netscape Navigator.
<p><b>coreconf:</b> The build system, based on config, that was developed
and is still used for NSS.
<p><b>svbld:</b> The internal iPlanet wide automated build and release
system.
<p><a NAME="history"></a>
<h3>

<hr>History</h3>
<b>1997:</b>
<ul>The browser team frequently "froze" builds based on the original monolithic
build system while browser problems were being resolved. When this happened,
the NSS team was blocked and could not address the needs of its other customers
at the time, the Netscape servers.
<p>Therefore, as part of the modularity work on Communicator, Netscape
engineers disentangled three components from the monolithic Communicator
build system to be built as separate binary components. These components
represented the basic code that has been shared by Netscape clients and
servers since the beginning:
<ul>
<li>
NSS provides the core security APIs.</li>

<li>
Netscape Portable Runtime (NSPR) provides a platform-neutral API for system
level and libc like functions</li>

<li>
DBM provides low-level data-base management services.</li>
</ul>
Once this was accomplished, the NSS team was able to meet its other customer
needs even when the browser team had to freeze development for the browser.
<p>To faciliate this change, we created a hybrid version of the client
and server build systems that made it possible to build, release, and import
binary NSS releases. At this point two important things happened:
<ul>
<li>
The client and server teams could not agree on a binary object-naming convention.</li>

<li>
The client team never implemented a binary import scheme. Instead, client
builds were accomplished by pulling the various components from a stable
NSS release tag (representing the source used to produce the latest QA'd
binary release).</li>
</ul>
Within a year, the needs of the various teams releasing binary components
fractured this build system into at least two versions: one used by NSS
and DBM and one used by NSPR. Although these versions diverged, they remained
close enough to move components easily from one build system to another.
<p>These closely related build systems had three major advantages over
the client build system:
<ul>
<li>
A single set of Makefiles worked on all platforms (with the exception of
Macintosh).</li>

<li>
The system could easily build separate components by importing binary versions
of dependent components. It was no longer necessary to build all the dependencies
prior to building one's one product. This greatly improved product development
time.</li>

<li>
The system ran with minimal external tool dependencies: <tt>ns/tools</tt>
for Windows, standard Unix commands for Unix plus either a native compiler/linker
or <tt>gcc</tt>.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<b>1998:</b>
<ul>Netscape announced the historic decision to develop all its browser
products as open source. Because of patent restrictions on proprietory
code and US export rules, we could not ship the source to our security
code at that time. Instead, we patched the client security calls with "hieroglyphs"
to obscure the security links in Communicator, which allowed us to publish
the rest of the source code.
<p>The original code contained the Netscape client's config build system
(on which coreconf was originally based). Over the next couple of years,
Mozilla developers converted the Unix build code to the autoconf system
(used by Linux and other open source developers). It started as wrappers,
and slowly moved to complete autoconf usage. At this time NSPR was integrated
with a dual build system, because NSPR still needed to build and maintain
binary releases as a component of the iPlanet server product releases.
A separate copy of DBM was converted to the autoconf build system.
<p>The NSS team went on to solve the problem of how we could produce a
security module that would
<ul>
<li>
work with a varienty of clients, each with its own version of NSPR (or
no version of NSPR)</li>

<li>
provide the same UI for each client</li>

<li>
allow multiple applications to share a common set of crytographic "tokens"
and certificates at the same time.</li>
</ul>
The result was <a href="../psm/">Personal Security Manager (PSM)</a>.
<p>At the same time, the Mozilla team made (or acquired) enhancements to
their build system to support the following capabilities:
<ul>
<li>
All the object files could be installed in a parallel tree (a feature that
the Windows version of Communicator had, but other platforms did not).</li>

<li>
The ability to build cross plaform.</li>

<li>
Parallel building.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<b>1999:</b>
<ul>In the wake of signals that the US Government was considering easing
the export regulations governing crypto software, the NSS team began the
process of sanitizing the NSS code and examining the impediments to building
a fully open source version of NSS. One issue we examined was the possibility
of converting to the autoconf build system. We attempted to build DBM as
a component without pulling the monolithic Mozilla build system. The proposal
was to give DBM its own autoconf system, which could be called separately
from the monolithic autoconf system.
<p>The Mozilla team rejected this suggestion. No alternative was available
and neither the Mozilla team nor the NSS team had the resources to address
the problem, which was not a high priority for either team. Coupled with
the difficulties the NSPR team was having with the dual build system, this
situation led the NSS team to maintain the coreconf build system for NSS.
<p>Because of the RSA patent, NSS used components built from proprietary
licensed source code that could not be publicly disclosed. For this reason,
and also because of export controls, the NSS team built PSM binaries internally
and distributed them only as a complete executable program.
<p>Another important event in 1999 was the acquisition of Netscape by AOL.
Soon after, the NSS engineering team, along with the other Netscape server
teams, became part of <a href="http://www.iplanet.com/index.html">iPlanet
E-Commerce Solutions</a>.</ul>
<b>2000:</b>
<ul>The RSA patent expired in September 2000, and the NSS team immediately
developed replacements for all the proprietary code on which NSS previously
depended. As a result of these changes, all NSS source could start being
posted to Mozilla. By December the PSM team had created a set of Makefiles
that could be attached to the mozilla build system.</ul>
<b>2001:</b>
<ul>Changes in export regulations allowed Netscape and Sun to ship NSS
in the form of shared libraries, so the NSS team modified NSS to ship as
shared libraries in addition to static libraries. In the process we added
<tt>.def</tt> files to control what symbols are exported from our shared
libraries.
<p>To understand the situation today (April 2001), it's important to recognize
that, unlike other Mozilla components, PSM, NSS, and NSPR each operate
under their own release schedules and product requirement documents (PRDs).
Because of this, tree locking and checkin rules will always differ between
the NSS build system and the Mozilla build system.
<p>In the future, as embedding becomes more important, more Mozilla components
will start branching off on their own schedules as well. In the long term,
iPlanet and other customer requirements for a separate NSS build system
converge with Mozilla requirements for separate components. The only difference
between NSS and other components in this respect is that NSS is a more
mature component with a broader customer base.
<p>At the same time, the Mozilla team may well have its own requirement
to be able to tweak the NSS branch of the Mozilla build system without
worrying about NSS release schedule or NSS team approval. Neither of these
requirements have ever been stated, but it would be foolish not to recognize
that they exist. These are the same requirements that led to the initial
bifurcation of coreconf in 1997.</ul>
<a NAME="special"></a>
<h3>

<hr>Special Considerations</h3>
In addition to meeting the different needs of various customers and engineering
teams, the current NSS build system takes account of various specialized
customer needs. Future work on the build system must take these considerations
into account.
<p>The main consideration involves performance. Most products built with
autoconf have code that is conditionally compiled based on the presence
or absence of some symbol in a system header file, such as a #define or
a certain function declaration. The objective of those measures is to produce
code that correctly compiles on all platforms, not using symbols or calling
functions that do not exist on all systems.
<p>Some people have wondered why NSS uses information about the particular
system for which it is being built as a basis for deciding what exactly
to build. The answer is that such information is vital to obtaining maximum
performance in NSS. Information that is system-dependent and cannot be
gleaned from header files includes the following:
<ul>
<li>
whether loop unrolling improves speed on that system or not</li>

<li>
whether byte writes are signficantly slower than word writes on that platform.</li>

<li>
whether byte reads are slower than word reads, shifting and masking</li>

<li>
whether the system has a FPU that is capable of doing 64-bit integer arithmetic</li>

<li>
whether using the FPU is faster than using the integer ALU for multiplication.</li>

<li>
compiler flaws--for example, does the compiler's preprocessor truncate
all values to 32 bits for evaluating #if expressions?</li>
</ul>
Some autoconf build systems include large and elaborate sets of programs
that attempt to determine the answers to those questions at build times,
e.g. running benchmarks, attempting to compile test sources and noting
compiler failures, etc. The amount of time required to implement such systems
is enormous.
<p>On many platforms, assembler code is necessary to get optimal performance
in time-critical functions. Such code is dependent on the type of the target
system and also the tools used to build. For example, <tt>gnu</tt> assembler
syntax is totally different from any system's native assembler. Such assembler
code is either present or not in the product's sources, and it is built,
or not, based on whether it is appropriate to the system and tools being
used. Such files will continue to be built based on information about the
system for which they are being built.

<h3>

<hr>iPlanet Requirements for the NSS Build System</h3>
The iPlanet NSS engineering team's customers and build requirements are
different from those of the Mozilla team. Unlike other Mozilla components,
PSM, NSS, and NSPR operate under their own release schedules and PRDs.
Because of this, tree locking and checkin rules will always differ from
those for Mozilla. The NSS team needs to be able to make adjustments to
its build system, whether based on coreconf or autoconf, without gates
or controls by the Mozilla team. This means NSS can never be part of a
monolithic build system.
<p>The iPlanet engineering team has the following general requirements
for the new NSS build system, in order of priority:
<ol>
<li>
Build NSS without pulling parts of Mozilla that iPlanet products do not
need or use and that are not being pulled in present NSS builds for iPlanet.</li>

<li>
Preserve and where possible improve the current level of performance, which
is important for many iPlanet server products.</li>

<li>
Build NSS with minimal external tools dependencies. The bigger these dependencies,
the bigger pressure on our release engineering team. When these dependencies
vary greatly from the dependencies of other components built by our release
team, iPlanet management starts asking nasty cost/value questions.</li>

<li>
Build all NSS platforms (except Macintosh, see note below) with a single
build system and a single set of Makefiles.</li>

<li>
Build from imported binary components. Production, QA'd versions of NSS
should be supplied by building with production, QA'ed, binary versions
of NSPR and DBM.</li>

<li>
Build as a component reliably on all platforms (except Macintosh, see below).</li>

<li>
Build from a single checked out tree on all NSS platforms simultaneously
(requirement of our svbld system).</li>
</ol>
<b>NOTE:</b> "All NSS platforms" in the list above does not include Macintosh.
The only component that needs NSS on Macintosh is PSM, so the PSM build
process also builds its own version of NSS for Macintosh.
<p><a NAME="mozillareqs"></a>
<h3>

<hr>Mozilla Requirements for the NSS Build System</h3>
We believe that Mozilla has the following requirements for the new NSS
build system, in order of priority:
<ol>
<li>
NSS should build reliably when invoked from the Mozilla build system.</li>

<li>
NSS should build from a read-only tree.</li>

<li>
NSS should build cross-platform.</li>

<li>
NSS should not interfere with the <tt>-j</tt> flag (that is, NSS should
not force serialization of a parallel build).</li>

<li>
NSS should be built by some standard autoconf invocation.</li>
</ol>
<a NAME="proposals"></a>
<h3>

<hr>Proposals</h3>
We are considering two proposals for a new NSS build system. Please send
comments to <a href="news://news.mozilla.org/mozilla.dev.tech.crypto">mozilla.dev.tech.crypto</a>.
<p><b>Proposal One:</b>
<ul>The NSS engineering team integrates the Mozilla build requirements
into coreconf. Mozilla Requirements 1 through 3 are relatively easy to
do in coreconf. It takes one day to get cross-plaform code working (there
is only one command in the coreconf build that needs to be native). coreconf
is already OBJDIR driven. It would take a couple of days to allow it to
build its objects into a separate object tree.
<p>Mozilla Requirement 4 requires more understanding about what parallelized
builds mean.
<p>Mozilla Requirement 5 is actually the hardest, although it seems to
be the lowest priority.
<p>In the meantime, the Mozilla team is working at its own pace toward
a componentized version of autoconf that can be used to produce a version
of NSS as simply and reliably as the current <a href="buildnss_32.html">NSS
3.2 Build Instructions</a>.
<p>This proposal meets all the listed requirements without using autoconf.</ul>
<b>Proposal Two:</b>
<ul>The NSS engineering team continues using its own build system, and
the Mozilla team develops a parallel build system that is decoupled from
NSS (preferably in a separate tree or tag). Developers can overlay the
parallel build system on an existing NSS tree to produce an autoconf tree
that the mozilla team may use to build NSS from. This build system is maintained
by the Mozilla community.
<p>The C code for this special tree would still be pulled from a stable,
tested version of NSS and not modified. This suggests a tree where autoconf
is overlayed on top of an existing NSS system. There is an example of this
already in <tt>security/dbm</tt>, where the security Makefiles pull in
the mozilla DBM source but use the coreconf build system to build DBM.
<p>The disadvantage of this proposal is we put off the work componentizing
the Mozilla build system until necko, gecko, or someone else needs it (which
is not necessarily a bad resource trade-off).</ul>
