<h2>JSS 4.0 Architecture Proposal</h2>
<h3>10 August 2001</h3>

<p>I propose we make some big architectural changes to JSS. I think it will
be much more valuable to developers if it is a complete Java security package.
This means doing things the Java way as much as possible.

<p>The changes are not interdependent. It is possible to undertake some of
them while delaying others that are less technically feasible.

<h2>Goals</h2>
<ul>
These design goals influenced the proposed architecture.

<p><li><b>JSS can be used without NSS or any other native code</b><br>
JSS has useful features beyond those implemented in NSS. External programmers
have used the ASN.1 parser and the PKCS #7 and PKCS #12 types.
<p>Programmers generally don't want to learn a new way of doing things. If JSS
is only available as a JNI package, and they need to do some work in pure-Java,
they will have to use a different package for the pure-Java work. Rather than
learn two different packages, they are more likely to just use the other package
for all their projects. But if JSS can be used without the JNI code, they
can use it for all their projects, and it could become their crypto package of
choice.
<p><li><b>JCA compliance</b><br>
Java developers strongly want to use the standard JCA API
for crypto operations.
<p><li><b>Validate certs according to the latest standards</b><br>
This means validating certs according to RFC2459 and it's successor
(<tt>draft-ietf-pkix-new-part1-??.txt</tt>), and support for OCSP.
<p><li><b>Maintain FIPS compliance</b><br>
Ideally, the NSS PKCS #11 token would be the only thing FIPS-validated.
<p><li><b>Maintain access to crypto hardware</b><br>
Everyone agrees that hardware is an essential feature.

<p><li><b>Flexible, open cert stores</b><br>
People should be able to plug-in multiple sources of certificates.
I don't like the way our security databases are currently proprietary. I think
they should be opened up, so that anyone can access and modify them, the
same way you can edit Apache's config file with any text editor.
This means allowing others to read/write the certificate database, and also
allowing alternative forms for certificate databases, such as XML files.

<p>This is not specific to Java. It would also be useful for Stan.

<p><li><b>No globals</b><br>
Data structures should not be global. This makes it possible to have
multiple independent crypto domains in a process (as in Stan). There 
may still need to be mechanisms for sharing common resources like files and
tokens.

<p><li><b>Make all the layers above and including PKCS #11 available</b><br>
Abstractions should be built a layer at a time, but all the layers should
be accessible to clients. This gives them more freedom to do new things without
having to respin JSS. The more sophisticated the client, the deeper they will
want to go.

<p>I want to make the PKCS #11 layer available to callers because some very
sophisticated callers might want to have access. For example, crypto hackers
who know what they're doing
might want to access PKCS #11 from Java. Or, something might come up where
our abstractions don't allow a client to do what he needs to do with a token.
We will need to work on cooperative access to PKCS #11 tokens within a process.
</ul>

<h2>Architecture</h2>
<ul>

<img src="jss4.0arch.jpg">

<p>I've tried to chunk the architecture into modules as much as possible.
All these APIs will be available to developers; they don't have to go through
the top level. Most will probably want to, but crazy hackers may want to fiddle
with low-level stuff. We should let them, because it will make JSS more
popular.

<p><li><b>TrustDomain</b><br>
I like the NSS concept of TrustDomains. I think the name is confusing; I'd
rather it were called a CryptoContext, and the individual operation contexts
were called something else. But to prevent confusion it's probably best
to standardize on the name.

<p>All information that would otherwise be global is stored in a TrustDomain.
Applications can have unlimited TrustDomains, and they are all independent
of each other.

<p><li><b>JCA Compliance</b><br>
JSS is already nearly JCA compliant. The crypto APIs in JSS look just
like the crypto APIs in JCA. I just need to make these classes exactly
implement the JCA spec.

<p>JCA currently doesn't have a way to distinguish which token will be used.
Most operations can just use the token that houses the key. Some operations
don't take a key argument: key generation, hashing, random number generation.
For each of these operations, the user will set a default token, and that
token will be used.

<p><li><b>Cert Validation</b><br>
This is a major new feature, and it's one of the things that Stan will bring
to NSS. The goal is to perform RFC2459-compliant cert path building and
validation. There is work on a
<a href="http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/55.jsp">Java standard</a> for this.
The standard is in the "public review" phase, but there's no schedule for
completion. The general layout of the API looks reasonable, but there may
be some problematic details.

<p>We will ship a default PKIXCertValidator, but clients can use whatever
implementation they want to validate certificates. Our cert stores and
sources will be available to them if they choose to write their own
validator.

<p><li><b>CertSource</b><br>
In order to build cert chains, the validator will access a collection
of CertSources. A CertSource is a searchable, read-only collection of
certificates. One implementation would be an LDAP directory. Another
implementation is a CertStore.

<p>To search, you create a selector object, which you populate will the
fields of the certificate you want to search on. Then you pass this
selector object to the CertSource. The CertSource returns matching
certificates.

<p><li><b>CertStore</b><br>
A CertStore is a read-write collection of certificates. The obvious
implementations are PKCS #11 tokens. I would also like a direct interface
to cert7.db so that we can handle migration if NSS moves away from that format.
Another implementation might be an XML file. Multiple cert stores can be
plugged into the certificate validator.

CertStore implements CertSource, so all certificate stores can also be used
as searchable sources of certificates.

<p><li><b>Signable Trust</b><br>
User's should be able to sign their trust information. One way to do this
is generate a keypair. The private key is stored in the encrypted key database.
It is used to sign the trust information. Currently, trust can be hacked by
modifying the user's cert7.db, which is not password-protected. If the trust
information were signed, they would have to hack the password-protected key
database.

<p>Another idea is for each user to have his own self-signed root certificate.
To trust a CA, the user would cross-certify that CA with his own certificate.
So, for example, if I wanted to trust Verisign, I would have the following
certs:

<pre>
My Self-Signed Personal CA
Issuer: Jamie Nicolson Trust Authority
Subject: Jamie Nicolson Trust Authority
</pre>

then, to trust Verisign, I would issue this certificate:

<pre>
My Cross-Certification of Verisign
Issuer: Jamie Nicolson Trust Authority
Subject: Verisign Class I blah blah blah...
</pre>

<p>The advantage of this scheme is it simplifies cert validation
logic, since there is only one trusted root certificate. All the other
root certs are treated the same as other certs. We can use various trust
limiters (name constraints, policies, etc.) to fine-tune the amount of 
trust we place in other CAs.

<p>The downside is how you revoke trust. Do we now have to maintain
our own CRL?

<p><li><b>PKCS #11 Token</b><br>
A PKCS #11 token Java class. It reveals all the functionality
of PKCS #11 tokens. There is still room for some abstraction: instead of
passing around handles, we would pass around objects that would store
the handles internally.

<p>We need to develop a way for NSS and JSS to "play nice" with each other
while sharing tokens.

<ul>
<p><li><b>Session handling</b><br>
In the JCA model, cryptographic operations are associated with a context.
A context is an object with methods like <tt>init()</tt>, <tt>update()</tt>,
and <tt>final()</tt>. I think it would be simplest if each context had
its own PKCS #11 session. This is a problem for tokens that support very few
concurrent sessions. <i>(Are there tokens like this?)</i>

<p>Also, a user is only logged into a token as long as at least one session
is around to remember the login state. On tokens that only support one
session, this single session must be reused for all operations. The PKCS #11
wrapper layer in NSS keeps one session around at all times to keep the
user logged in.

<p>Since each JSS operation would have its own session, it won't 
conflict with NSS. JSS and NSS both need to have access to the
mutex of non-thread-safe tokens.

<p><li><b>Key Juggling</b><br>
The API will allow users to move keys between tokens explicitly, and return
an error if one of the tokens doesn't allow it. I think moving keys
automatically without the user's knowledge is confusing. The application
can always do this itself, and if they frequently do it the same way,
we can add that algorithm as a convenience function later.

</ul>

</ul>

<h2>Phases</h2>
<ol>
All this work doesn't have to be at once. We can phase in the changes. Here's
a breakdown:
<p><li><b>Full JCA compliance</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Make the crypto classes implement the JCA engine interfaces so that
JSS can be used as a JCA provider for all the operations it supports.
<p><li>Implement a JSSE (SSL) provider by implementing an NSPR wrapper
around a Java socket.
</ul>
<p><li><b>Certificate Handling</b><br>
Implement the CertificateValidator, CertStore, and CertSource classes.
<p><li><b>PKCS #11-level API in Java</b><br>
Reflect PKCS #11 directly into Java, and change our JCA provider to
call this instead of native routines.
</ol>
