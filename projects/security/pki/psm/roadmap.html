<h3>
Where We Are Now</h3>

Work on the next generation of PSM technology has started. With PSM 2.0,
we plan to provide an in-process SSL implementation that takes advantage
of all the technologies provided to us by Mozilla. PSM 2.0 
will not work with Communicator 4.7x browsers as PSM1.x did, but will be
strictly a Mozilla browser component. Any other projects that use
the Mozilla code base in their project will be able to pick up the new
implementation and have SSL work.
<h3>
Where We're Going</h3>
Work related to Personal Security Manager is proceeding in the following
areas:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Netscape Personal Security Manager for Communicator 4.x.</b> This
version goes into maintenance mode. Only bugs deemed extremely harmful
to the end user or the end user's system will be considered for a fix. 
We will forgo minor bug fixes to this version in favor of adding functionality
and features to PSM 2.0.</li>

<li>
<b>Netscape Personal Security Manager for Mozilla.</b> This version
goes into maintenance mode under the same conditions as Netscape Personal
Security Manager for Communicator 4.x.</li>

<li>
<b>PSM 2.0 for Mozilla.</b> This version will use the mozilla environment to 
provide functionality equivalent to that provided by the interfaces
at <a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/extensions/psm-glue/src/nsPSMModule.cpp#59">psm-glue</a>
. This version will also require implementing the UI mockups under development at 
<a href="http://people.netscape.com/lord/psm/readmefirst.html">UI.</a>
PSM 2.0 will provide UI for many of the error cases that PSM and
Netscape clients have provided in the past, and will also allow 
other projects to customize behavior when SSL error
conditions occur.</li>

<li>
<b>PSM 2.0 For Embedding Projects</b> The new PSM will be flexible
enough to permit any embedding project that picks up necko and gecko to
pick up the new PSM and have SSL functioning without any of the
other PKI-related features available to Mozilla. Each embedding project
must define the behavior for PSM in error cases.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
How We're Going To Do It</h3>
PSM 2.0 will consist of XPCOM shared libraries just like every component
used by Mozilla: <tt>pipnss</tt> and <tt>pippki</tt>.

<h4>
<tt>pipnss</tt></h4>
The base shared library will be <tt>pipnss</tt> (i.e. <tt>libpipnss.so</tt> on Linux and
<tt>pipnss.dll</tt> on Win32). This library will be a generic mozilla
module, will register XPCOM components, and will link in the static version of NSS
3.2. It will be the only library provided by PSM that links with NSS directly.
NSS 3.2 will support shared libraries, but there will not be enough symbols
exported to implement all of the features required of PSM 2.0.
When NSS releases a version that exports enough symbols to implement all
of the features to be implemented by PSM, then this issue may be reconsidered
and multiple shared libraries may link with NSS if the PSM team decides
that solution is acceptable.
<p><tt>pipnss</tt> will register objects that handle all of the SSL sockets required
of necko. Currently there are three instances of sockets required by
necko: 
<ul>
	<li>Default SSL socket, provided by NSS
	<li>SSL Socket, which forces the handshake
	<li>a socket that can upgrade from a clear socket to an SSL socket

</UL>

<p>Each socket may have a listener attached to it that will handle conditions
that require UI. Such conditions could be caused by 
an expired web site certificate or the need for the user select a 
certificate for SSL client authentication.

<p>If there is no listener attached to the socket that can handle a given
condition, then pipnss will terminate the connection and report a "could
not connect" error (or some equivalent). This has the advantage
of not requiring embedding projects to bring up UI (since some projects
may not support UI) and is flexible enough to allow different SSL protocols
to handle error messages differently. For example, the HTTPS protocol
may need to present the user with a dialog if the web site certificate
has expired, whereas LDAPS may decide to fail silently in such cases. 
The protocol implementation, rather than the SSL provider, decides what 
constitutes correct behavior.

<p>Since it will be the only module that directly links against NSS,
<tt>pipnss</tt> will define IDL interfaces for access to NSS functions and implement
those interfaces. This will prevent other components that want to
use NSS from having to link in their own copy of NSS and prevent
two copies of NSS from running simultaneously in two separate modules.
When other components need access to NSS, they can look up the interfaces
implemented by pipnss and call NSS through those interfaces.
<p>There will not be any XUL files included with this module.
<p>This module will be picked up by embedding projects and the Mozilla/Netscape
browser.

<h4>
<tt>pippki</tt></h4>
The <tt>pippki</tt> module will implement the
<a href="http://people.netscape.com/lord/psm/readmefirst.html">PSM 2.0 UI</a>. 
It will define all of the XPCOM objects needed to implement
the UI using XUL. Specification of these XPCOM objects will be described in
a future document. This library will also bundle all of the XUL that implements the UI.

The library will query for the necessary NSS interfaces
provided by <tt>pipnss</tt> when NSS operations are needed. To avoid bloating 
footprint size, this library will not link with any NSS libraries.

<p>The Secret Decoder Ring (SDR) implementation, needed by the Password
Manager in Mozilla, will be bundled into this module as well. If
in the future the PSM team decides there is enough demand for SDR functionality
apart from the other features provided by the rest of the <tt>pippki</tt> module,
then the SDR functionality may be be split into its own module.

<p>The Mozilla/Netscape browser uses this module, but embedding projects need not 
pick it up unless they need all the PSM-related security UI provided by the 
Mozilla/Netscape browser.
