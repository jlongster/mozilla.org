<A NAME="certificate"></A><A NAME="1018895">
<B>certificate.</B>&nbsp;
</A><A NAME="1018896">
The digital equivalent of an ID card. A certificate specifies the name of an individual, company, or other entity and certifies that a public key, which is included in the certificate, belongs to that entity. When you digitally sign a message or other data, the digital signature for that message is created with the aid of the private key that corresponds to the public key in your certificate. A certificate is issued and digitally signed by a <a href="glossary.html#1020903">certificate authority (CA)</a>. A certificate's validity can be verified by checking the CA's <a href="glossary.html#1013995">digital signature</a>.

A service that issues a certificate after verifying the identity of the person or entity the certificate is intended to identify. A CA also renews and revokes certificates and generates a list of revoked certificates at regular intervals. CAs can be independent vendors (such as the CAs listed at <a href= "https://certs.netscape.com/" TARGET="_blank">Client Certificates</a>) or a person or organization using certificate-issuing server software (such as Netscape Certificate Management System).

<B>certificate fingerprint.</B>&nbsp;
</A><A NAME="1020326">
A unique number associated with a certificate. The number is not part of the certificate itself but is produced by applying a mathematical function to the contents of the certificate.

<B>certificate verification.</B>&nbsp;
</A><A NAME="1025531">
When <a href="#Certificate_Manager">Certificate Manager</a> verifies a certificate, it confirms that the digital signature was created by a CA whose own CA certificate is both on file with Certificate Manager and marked as trusted for issuing that kind of certificate. It also confirms that the certificate being verified has not itself been marked as untrusted. Finally, if the <a href="glossary.html#1029304">Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)</a> has been activated, Certificate Manager also performs an online check. It does so by looking up the certificate in a list of valid certificates maintained at a URL that is specified either in the certificate itself or in the browser's validation preferences. If any of these checks fail, Certificate Manager marks the certificate as unverified and won't recognize the identity it certifies.<P>
