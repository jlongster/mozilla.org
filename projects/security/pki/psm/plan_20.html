<a name="intro"><h3>
Introduction</h3></a>
Early last year, we contributed PSM to the open source community along with <a href="index.html">
Network Security Services (NSS)</a>. All the code 
that we could publish was released on mozilla.org. Initially, builds of PSM intended for use with 
Mozilla, Netscape 6, and Communicator still relied on proprietary
code licensed from RSA Security, Inc., by Netscape. Soon after the RSA patent expired last fall, 
we reimplemented the RSA algorithm from scratch. We were then able to build NSS, and therefore PSM, 
completely from open source code.

<p>PSM 1.4 ships with Netscape 6 and is also available for use with Communicator 4.7 and later versions. It 
runs as a separate process, displaying its UI in HTML windows when necessary. 
(For background information on the origins of this architecture, 
see <a href="history.html">A Brief History 
of Personal Security Manager</a>.) 

<p>The main goal of PSM 2.0 (Codename: PSM in Process, or PIP) is to run in-process as a fully integrated 
Mozilla component. Other goals are listed below. Although S/MIME is not a feature of PSM 2.0, we will be laying 
the groundwork for S/MIME features in later releases.

<p>For a technical view of where we're going with 
different flavors of PSM and how the the PSM 2.0 XPCOM shared libraries will be organized, see
<a href="roadmap.html">PSM 2.0 Roadmap: A Technical View</a>.

<p>For a detailed breakdown of tasks and dependencies related to PSM 2.0, see 
<a href="piptasks.html">PSM 2.0 Task List</a>.

 

<hr size="1" width="100%">
<a name ="goals"><h3>Goals</h3></a>
<p>PSM 2.0 has the following goals:

<ol> 
	<li><b>Complete integration with Mozilla</b>. PSM 1.x has provided a 
number of important benefits over the past two years as Communicator has matured and Netscape 6.0 
was developed and released. However, we now want to integrate PSM with Mozilla, so that PSM 2.0 
will look just like other Mozilla components. It will use XPCOM, XUL, and language locales. It will
be an in-process component. It will use autoconf, regardless 
of support for autoconf in NSS. Any other projects that use the Mozilla code base 
will be able to pick up the new implementation and have SSL work.


	<li><b>Real modularity</b>. Some customers will not want to use PSM 
for their applications. Version 2.0 will have a clean 
separation from the rest of the Mozilla code base. In other words, 
if you don't have PIP, you won't see any PIP preferences, the Certificate Manger, the lock icon, 
and so on in the Mozilla client. When you install the PIP XPI file, the preferences and the rest of 
the UI will show up.

	<li><b>Support for embedded systems</b>. Embedding teams can use 
just the crypto components without relying on our XUL infrastructure. 
Such customers include set-top box developers. All features 
must be accessible via APIs, not just our UI.</li>

	<li><b>Think ahead about S/MIME</b>. The work we do for PSM 2.0 will lay the groundwork 
for S/MIME features to be introduced in later releases. Although we're not doing any S/MIME work for 
PIP at this time, we want to make sure that the UI and APIs don't have to change when we start to 
imlement S/MIME features.
</ol> 

<p><a name="Feature_List"></a></p> <hr size="1"> 
<h3>PSM 2.0 Prioritized Feature List</h3> 

<ol> 
	<li>Retain all existing <b>PSM 1.4 functionality</b> including (but not 
limited to) these features:</li> 
	<ul> 
		<li>Servers can determine what version of PSM a client is using by using 
a browser-side JavaScript call (as in PSM 1.x).</li> 
		<li>Single-click/CRMF certificate issuance 
(with UI) </li> 
		<li>The Registration Authority has the option of suppressing the back-up dialog during certificate 
issuance</li> 
		<li>Interruption or discontinuation of the certificate issuance process does not 
corrupt the certificate/key database</li> 
		<li>User-prompted renewal of certificates</li> 
		<li>PSM can be installed by loading and running the appropriate XPI file.</li> 
		<li>OCSP support.</li> 
		<li>Dual key generation support</li> 
		<li>Client-auth logout capability via the <tt>crypto.logout</tt> call from JavaScript</li> 
		<li>Encryption key escrow</li> 
		<li>Existing SDR functionality (used to support the Password Manager).</li> 
		<li>PKCS#11 support</li> 
		<li>PKCS#12 support<br> </li> 
	</ul> 
	<li>Correct <b>NLS</b> support. When you switch locales, PSM inherits those changes.</li> 
	<li>The <b>lock icon</b> will work correctly. 
	<li>PSM will have a <b>new UI</b> written in XUL: </li> 
	<ul> 
		<li>Preferences will migrate to Edit/Preferences</li> 
		<li>Status info for S/MIME and SSL goes to View/Page Info</li> 
		<li>Certificate management becomes its own XUL window (see the demo here)</li> 
		<li>We will introduce a new Smart Card Manager window.</li> 
	</ul> 
	<li>Preserve <b>IDL interfaces</b> that necko depends on</li> 
	<li>Full <b>START_TLS </b>support. PSM will not need to handle unencrypted 
network traffic. Protocols that support START_TLS will work as expected. When a protocol 
handler encounters a START_TLS request from the server, it will be able to invoke PSM. </li> 
	<li>The <b>builds</b> system will use autoconf (even if NSS does not). PSM will be 
part of the standard Mozilla build process for Mac, Win32, and Linux. It will be possible 
to build a Mozilla browser <i>without 
            PSM.</i> </li> 
	<li>PSM 2.0 will <b>perform</b> well enough for the following purposes:</li> 
	<ul> 
		<li>SSL performance will be better than C4.7 (without PSM)</li> 
		<li>SSL performance will be better than N6.0.</li> 
		<li>PSM will be able to encrypt/decrypt fast enough to allow someone 
else to add disk encryption of prefs, history, bookmarks, locally stored 
mail files. Other possible targets of disk encryption include skins, news 
cache, and web cache. Goal: encrypt/decrypt 1MB/second.</li> 
	</ul> 
	<li>Full HTTPS <b>proxy</b> support (as in Commnicator 4.7x)</li> 
	<li>PSM 2.0 will be at least 10% <b>smaller</b> than PSM 1.4 on win32 and Linux. </li> 
<li><b>S/MIME ready</b>.&nbsp; The UI and APIs (where applicable) will be S/MIME ready. 
That is, S/MIME functionality should be a super-set of PIP. The S/MIME developers will not need 
to change PIP when adding their own features. </li> 
	<li>No <b>nicknames</b>. The user will not be able to name or rename certificates. 
From the user's point of view, there is no longer any such thing as a "certificate nickname". 
Instead, the new UI should show enough information about a certificate that nicknames are 
not necessary. </li>
	<li><b>Display of CA</b>. When you click on the lock icon, Mozilla will open the Page 
Info window. The CA should be displayed in the chrome during SSL connections.</li> 
	<li><b>SSL version 2</b> is off by default</li> 
	<li><b>Auto-cert select</b> is on by default</li> 
	<li><b>TLS is </b>on by default</li> 
	<li><b>Password quality</b> meter will teach users to select good passwords. 
		</li> 
	<li>Use <b>NSS 3.2</b> libraries in their static form (we won't be able to use the shared  
libraries).</li> 
	<li>PSM can be linked with or without NSS's S/MIME library.</li> 
	<li><b>Basic-auth logins over SSL</b> should show a lock in the Name/Password dialog box to 
tell the user that his/her password will not be sent over the  Internet in the clear.</li> 
</ol> 


<hr size="1" width="100%">

<a name="psm_ui"><h3>New User Interface</h3></a>
           
PSM 2.0 will have an all-new UI written in XUL rather than in HTML:

<ul>
		<li><a href="http://people.netscape.com/lord/psm/readmefirst.html">PSM 2.0 UI</a> describes ongoing work on 
the PSM 2.0 UI, including links to current XUL mockups that you can install and play with.

	<li><a href="pip_ui_elements.html">Text for PSM UI Elements</a> lists all PSM 2.0 UI elements, the text they contain, and 
other details related to context-sensitive help.

	<li><a href="piptasks.html">PSM 2.0 Task List</a> provides a detailed breakdown of tasks and dependencies, including 
UI elements.

</ul>
