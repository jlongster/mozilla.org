<h2><a name="info">Project Information</a></h2>

<p>
python-nss is a Python binding for NSS (Network Security Services) and
NSPR (Netscape Portable Runtime). NSS is built upon NSPR because NSPR
provides an abstraction of common operating system services,
particularly in the areas of networking and process management. Python
also provides an abstraction of common operating system services but
because NSS and NSPR are tightly bound python-nss exposes elements of
NSPR. 

<p>
For information on NSS and NSPR, see the following:

<ul>
 <li><a href="../nss/">Network Security Services (NSS)</a>. NSS project page.</li>
 <li><a href="../../../nspr/">Netscape Portable Runtime</a>. NSPR project page.</li>
 <li><a href="../../../nspr/reference/html/">NSPR Reference</a>. NSPR API documentation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Design Goals</h3>

<p>
NSS and NSPR are C language API's which python-nss "wraps" and exposes
to Python programs. The design of python-nss follows these basic
guiding principles:

<ul>
  <li>
    Be a thin layer with almost a one-to-one mapping of NSS/NSPR calls
    to python methods and functions. Programmers already familiar with
    NSS/NSPR will be quite comfortable with python-nss.
  </li><li>
    Be "Pythonic". The term Pythonic means to follow accepted Python
    paradigms and idoms in the Python language and libraries. Thus
    when deciding if the NSS/NSPR API should be rigidly followed or a
    more Pythonic API provided the Pythonic implementation
    wins because Python programmers do not want to write C programs in
    Python, rather they want their Python code to feel like Python
    code with the richness of full Python.
  </li><li>
    Identifer names follow the preferred Python style instead of the
    style in the NSS/NSPR C header files.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Classes are camel-case. Class names always begin with a
        upper case letter and are then followed by a mix of lower and
        upper case letters, a upper case letter is used to separate
        words. Acronyms always appear as a contiguous string of
        upper case letters.
      </li><li>
        Method, function and property names are always lower case with
        words seperated by underscores.
      </li><li>
        Constants are all upper case with words seperated by
        underscores, they match the NSS/NSPR C API.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li><li>
    Every module, class, function, and method has associated
    documentation and is exposed via the standard Python
    methodology. This documentation is available via the numerous
    Python documentation extraction tools. Also see the generated HTML
    documentation provided with each release. The current release's
    documentation can be found <a href="fixme">here</a>.
  </li><li>
    NSS/NSPR structs are exposed as Python objects.
  </li><li>
    NSS/NSPR functions which operate on a NSS/NSPR object
    (i.e. struct) become methods of that object.
  </li><li>
    NSS/NSPR objects which are collections support the Python
    iteration protocol. In other words they can be iterated over,
    indexed by position, or used as slices.
  </li><li>
    NSS/NSPR objects whose collection elements can be referenced by
    name support associative indexing.
  </li><li>
    NSS/NSPR objects which have "get" and "set" API function calls are
    exposed as Python properties.
  </li><li>
    All NSS/NSPR Python objects can print their current value by evaluting
    the Python object in a string context or by using the Python str()
    function.
  </li><li>
    Support threading. The Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is
    released prior to calling NSS/NSPR C functions and reaquired after
    the NSS/NSPR C function returns. This allows other Python threads
    to execute during the time a NSS/NSPR function is progress in
    another thread. Also, any "global" values which are set in
    python-nss are actually thread-local. Examples of this are the
    various callbacks which can be set and their parameters. Thus each
    thread gets it own set of callbacks.
  </li><li>
    Many methods/functions provide sane default (keyword) parameters
    freeing the Python programmer from having to specify all
    parameters yet allowing them to be overriden when necessary.
  </li><li>
    Error codes are <em>never</em> returned from
    methods/functions. python-nss follows the existing Python
    exception mechanism. Any error reported by NSS/NSPR is converted
    into a Python exception and raised. The exact error code, error
    description, and often contextual error information will be
    present in the exception object.
  </li><li>
    Enumerated constants used in the NSS/NSPR API's are available in
    the Python module under the <em>exact</em> same name as they
    appear in the C header files of NSS/NSPR.
  </li><li>
    Convenience functions are provided to translate between the
    numeric value of an enumerated constant and it's string
    representation and visa versa.
  </li><li>
    python-nss internally supports UTF-8. Strings may be Python str
    objects or Python unicode objects. If a Python unicode object is
    passed to a NSS/NSPR function it will be encoded as UTF-8 first
    before being passed to NSS/NSPR.
  </li><li>
    python-nss tries to be flexible when generating a print
    representation of complex objects. For simplicity you can receive
    a block of formatted text but if you need more control, such as
    when building GUI elments you can access a list of "lines", each line
    is paired with an indentation level value. The (indent, text)
    pairs allow you to insert the item into a GUI tree structure or
    simply change the indentation formatting.
  </li><li>
    Deprecated elements of the python-nss API are marked with Python
    deprecation warnings as well as being documented in the nss module
    documentation. As of Python 2.7 deprecation warnings are no longer
    reported by default. It is suggested Python developers using
    python-nss periodically run their code with deprecation warnings
    enabled. Depercated elements will persist for a least two releases
    before being removed from the API entirely.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="project_history">Project History</a></h2>

Red Hat utilizes both NSS and Python in many of it's projects, however
it was not previously possible to call NSS directly from Python. To
solve this problem Red Hat generously funded the initial development
of python-nss as well as it's continued maintenance. Red Hat following
it's open source philosophy has contributed the source to the Mozilla
security project. Red Hat welcomes all interested contributors who
would like to contribute the the python-nss project as part of an open
source community.

The initial release of python-nss occurred in September 2008 with it's
inclusion in the Fedora distribution. The source code to python-nss
was first imported into the Mozilla CVS repository on June 9th
2009. python-nss is currently available in:

<ul>
  <li>
    Fedora
  </li><li>
    RHEL 6
  </li>
</ul>

The principal developer of python-nss is John
Dennis <a href="mailto:jdennis@redhat.com">jdennis@redhat.com</a>. Additional
contributors are:

<ul>
  <li>
  Miloslav Trmač <a href=:mailto:mitr@redhat.com>mitr@redhat.com</a>
  </li>
</ul>


<p>
The python-nss binding is still young despite having been utilized in
several major software projects. Thus it's major version number is
still at zero. This is primarily so the developers can make changes to
the API as experiece grows with it. For example it is already known
there are some naming inconsistencies. Elments of the API are probably
not ideally partitioned into proper namespaces via Python
modules. Some functionality and interface have already been deprecated
due to lessons learned. Thus at some point in the future when it is
felt the API has solidified and been further proven in the field a 1.0
release will be made. At that point in time existing users of the
python-nss API will need to some elements of their code. A migration
script will be provided to assist them.

      <h5>External Changes</h5>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Add AddrInfo class to support IPv6 address resolution. Supports
          iteration over it's set of NetworkAddress objects and provides
          hostname, canonical_name object properties.
        </li><li>
          Add PR_AI_* constants.
        </li><li>
          NetworkAddress constructor and NetworkAddress.set_from_string() added
          optional family parameter. This is necessary for utilizing
          PR_GetAddrInfoByName().
        </li><li>
          NetworkAddress initialized via a string paramter are now initalized via
          PR_GetAddrInfoByName using family.
        </li><li>
          Add NetworkAddress.address property to return the address
          sans the port as a string. NetworkAddress.str() includes the
          port. For IPv6 the a hex string must be enclosed in brackets if a
          port is appended to it, the bracketed hex address with appended
          with a port is unappropriate in some circumstances, hence the new
          address property to permit either the address string with a port
          or without a port.
        </li><li>
          Fix the implementation of the NetworkAddress.family property, it was
          returning bogus data due to wrong native data size.
        </li><li>
          HostEntry objects now support iteration and indexing of their
          NetworkAddress members.
        </li><li>
          Add io.addr_family_name() function to return string representation of
          PR_AF_* constants.
        </li><li>
          Modify example and test code to utilize AddrInfo instead of deprecated
          NetworkAddress functionality. Add address family command argument to
          ssl_example.
        </li><li>
          Fix pty import statement in test/setup_certs.py
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Deprecated Functionality</h5>

      <ul>
        <li>
          NetworkAddress initialized via a string paramter is now
          deprecated. AddrInfo should be used instead.
        </li><li>
          NetworkAddress.set_from_string is now deprecated. AddrInfo should be
          used instead.
        </li><li>
          NetworkAddress.hostentry is deprecated. It was a bad idea,
          NetworkAddress objects can support both IPv4 and IPv6, but a HostEntry
          object can only support IPv4. Plus the implementation depdended on
          being able to perform a reverse DNS lookup which is not always
          possible.
        </li><li>
          HostEntry.get_network_addresses() and HostEntry.get_network_address()
          are now deprecated. In addition their port parameter is now no longer
          respected. HostEntry objects now support iteration and
          indexing of their NetworkAddress and that should be used to access
          their NetworkAddress objects instead.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Internal Changes</h5>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Utilize PR_NetAddrFamily() access macro instead of explict access.
        </li><li>
          Add PRNetAddr_port() utility to hide host vs. network byte order
          requirements when accessing the port inside a PRNetAddr and simplify
          accessing the IPv4 vs. IPv6 port variants.
        </li><li>
          Replace the use of PR_InitializeNetAddr() with PR_SetNetAddr(), the
          later properly handles IPv6, the former did not.
        </li><li>
          Rename NetworkAddress.addr to NetworkAddress.pr_netaddr for naming
          consistency.
        </li><li>
          Update HostEntry documentation to indicate it's deprecated status.
        </li><li>
          Remove redundant implementation of NetworkAddress_new_from_PRNetAddr
          from py_ssl.c and properly import the implementation from py_nspr_io.c.
        </li><li>
          The following other non-IPv6 fixes were also made because they were
          discovered while doing the IPv6 work:
        </li><li>
          Move definition of TYPE_READY to py_nspr_common.h so it can be
          shared. Update all modules to utilize it.
        </li><li>
          Replace incorrect use of free() with PyMem_Free for string data
          returned by Python's utf-8 encoder.
        </li><li>
          Add header dependency information to setup.py so modules will be
          rebuilt when header files change.
        </li><li>
          Add utility tuple_str() to convert a tuple to a string representation
          by calling str() on each object in the tuple. Tuple.str() in CPython
          only calls repr() on each member.
        </li><li>
          HostEntry objects now store their aliases and NetworkAddress's in
          internal tuples.
        </li>
      </ul>
