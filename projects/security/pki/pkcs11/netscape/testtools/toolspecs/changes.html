<H2>
&nbsp;1. Overview</H2>
In order to have ability to use single source and single executable to
test wide range of cases some modifications are required to current versions
of replacer and regress.&nbsp; Simple way to achieve this flexibility is
to inject all tested data in a form of following structures.

<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; data_type data_table[] = {</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; data-1,</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... ,</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; data-n</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</TT>

<P>These tables can be constructed and injected by replacer from the data
collected from its template file. This way we can use single executable
to test all required cases.

<P>Regress has to run each test with test ID as a parameter, which will
let test executable to extract enough information to select appropriate
data.&nbsp; Test ID encoding and decoding can be done many ways.&nbsp;
A simply method is to use multiplication and division.&nbsp; Let do simple
example to illustrate this method.&nbsp; Lets assume that we are testing
n variables. Each of them has known number of values <TT>M1, M2, M3, ...
,Mn</TT>. and selected variables are <TT>V1, V2, ..., Vn</TT>.

<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; testId = (…((Vn*Mn-1 + Vn-1)*Mn-2 + Vn-2)*Mn-3
+ …)*M1 + V1;</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; V1 = testId % M1;</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; V2 = (testId / M1) % M2;</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; V3 = ((testId / M1) / M2) % M3;</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... ;</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vn = (…((testId / M1) / M2)…) % Mn;</TT>

<P>This means, that replacer has to replace <TT>$[VARIABLEn]</TT> with
corresponding <TT>data_table[(…((testId/M1)/M2)…)%Mn]</TT> instead of specific
data as before.
<BR><TT>testId</TT> will be retrieved from test’s first argument.
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; testId = atoi(argv[1]);</TT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<H2>
1. Replacer Modifications</H2>

<UL>
<LI>
General information block in replacer template file has to specify singleSource
= TRUE to indicate new way of testing or singleSource can be pass as a
replacer argument.</LI>

<LI>
Template file specification has to introduce two new “Meta-Variables” $[DATA-TO-TEST]
and $[SET-TEST-ID]. $[DATA-TO-TEST] will let replacer to inject all tested
data. $[SET-TEST-ID] will let replacer to set testId.</LI>

<LI>
Each tested variable has to have specified type in its information block
contained by replacer template file. This can be define as follow: TYPE
= data_type</LI>

<LI>
Regress template file produce by replacer has to have a way to indicate
test IDs to be tested.</LI>
</UL>
&nbsp;
<H2>
2. Regress Modifications</H2>

<UL>
<LI>
Regress template file has to contain test IDs generated by replacer.&nbsp;
This can be implemented by added statement testId = testIdValue for each
test information block</LI>

<LI>
Current format for regress template file is very inefficient for big number
tests, because it stores number of information per each test.</LI>

<BR>Situation can be improved
<BR>- by moving “program” from test information block to general information
block since program name is the same for tests.
<BR>- by removing “testname” from test information block and adding all
necessary components to build above name to general information block
<BR>- by letting regress elect random values for the low importance variable
we can eliminate necessity to pass test IDs through regress template file.</UL>
&nbsp;
<H2>
3. Advantages</H2>

<UL>
<LI>
Space savings</LI>

<BR>Instead of producing significant number of source files and executables,
we can operate on single source and executable.
<LI>
Time savings</LI>

<BR>There is no need to waste time to produce huge number of sources, compile
them and link them.
<LI>
Debugging</LI>

<BR>There is no need to retrieve or regenerate appropriate sources and
executables to start debugging</UL>
&nbsp;
<H2>
4. Disadvantages</H2>

<UL>
<LI>
You have to be aware of possible syntax conflict between injected data
tables and source template variables.</LI>

<LI>
Numbers of combinations is limited by test ID representation, which is
currently implemented as “int”.<BR>
This means, that for example on 32-bit platforms numbers of combinations
is limited to 2,147,483,647.</LI>
</UL>
&nbsp;
<H2>
5. Porting test suites</H2>

<UL>
<LI>
add “singleSource = TRUE” in general section of the replacer template file</LI>

<LI>
add $[DATA-TO-TEST] and $[SET-TEST-ID] in the replacer C template file</LI>

<LI>
makefile won’t be modified, because there is no need for it</LI>

<LI>
use exit codes from the range of 1 to 255, 256 reserved to indicate crash</LI>
</UL>
