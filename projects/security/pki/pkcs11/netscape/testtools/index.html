The Netscape PKCS #11 test suites make use of two testing tools whose source is available 
with the source for the test suites (links bring you to each tool's documentation):

<ul>
   <li><a href="regress.html">Regress</a>. Regress is a test suite automation 
and reporting tool that runs a parameterized test program over a number of variables. 
It is controlled by a specification file that lists the variable combinations to be
executed. Test result tables are output to an HTML file, which can be
organized with the <a href="reporter.html">reporter</a> tool.
   <li><a href="reporter.html">Reporter</a>. Reporter automates the web indexing
of regression results generated by the <A HREF="testtools/regress.html">regress</A> tool.
Reporter uses a specification file that defines the 
Component/Test Suite/Platform topology of the report directory 
structure. The tool then parses all the individual regress summary 
files found at the lowest level of the reporting hierarchy and updates all
the intermediate index.htm files. The reporter tool is expected
to automate the routine maintenance of updating web content to form an
orderly and predictable testing results web that can be reindexed
automatically.
</ul>

<p>A third tool, replacer, is designed to produce a larger number of programs 
that are nearly identical, differing by only a few variables. This program is
ideal for creating regression test suites on APIs or programs that have large 
numbers of variables. It is not explicitly used by the Netscape 
PKCS #11 test suites.

<p>Detailed design specifications for all three testing tools--
regress, reporter, and replacer--are available at <a href="toolspecs/">Test Tool Specifications</a>.
