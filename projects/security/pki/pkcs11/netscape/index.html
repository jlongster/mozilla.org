<P>The Netscape PKCS #11 Test Suites are designed to help vendors of PKCS #11-compliant
cryptographic hardware verify compatibility with Netscape software.

<h3> <a name="status"> </a>Status</h3>

<b>Please read the following notices on the status of the Netscape test suites first.</b>

<ul>
  <li>Tools: The tools regress, reporter, and replacer have yet to be released.
  <li>The tests suite: The test source code was written to use NSS 2.x, not NSS 3.x,
and would take a lot of work to make it build and run with the current NSS 3.x. Volunteers
for this work are welcome.
  <li>Other tests : NSS has two other programs that are used for PKCS#11 testing. They
are pk11mode and pk11util. The sources to both are in nss/cmd.
</ul>

<h3> <a name="testsuites"> </a>Test Suites</h3>

The following Netscape test suites will soon be available in the Mozilla CVS tree 
(the trivial test is already checked in):

<ul>
   <li><a href="pk11test.html">PKCS #11 Test Suite</a>. Uses the regress tool to exercise the PKCS #11
operations most commonly accessed from Netscape products through the PKCS #11 interface. 
   <li><a href="ssltest.html">SSL Test Suite</a>. Uses the regress tool to 
run a series of test programs (up to 8000). Each test opens a client and server 
SSL socket and transfers data between the two. By default, the suite runs on the 
NSS libraries, but it can be configured to run over any PKCS #11 cryptographic
provider.
   <li><a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/security/nss/tests/pkcs11/netscape/trivial/README.txt">Trivial</a>. 
A simple test that loads a cryptoki module and performs
some basic excercises, such as querying information and opening sessions.
</ul>

Running these tests against your PKCS #11 implementation will help expose 
incompatibilities that could otherwise be found by manual testing only. 


<h3> <a name="testtools"> </a>Testing Tools</h3>

The Netscape PKCS #11 test suites make use of two testing tools whose source is available 
with the source for the test suites (links bring you to each tool's documentation):

<ul>
   <li><a href="testtools/regress.html">Regress</a>. Regress is a test suite automation 
and reporting tool that runs a parameterized test program over a number of variables. 
It is controlled by a specification file that lists the variable combinations to be
executed. Test result tables are output to an HTML file, which can be
organized with the <a href="testtools/reporter.html">reporter</a> tool.
   <li><a href="testtools/reporter.html">Reporter</a>. Reporter automates the web indexing
of regression results generated by the <A HREF="testtools/regress.html">regress</A> tool.
Reporter uses a specification file that defines the 
Component/Test Suite/Platform topology of the report directory 
structure. The tool then parses all the individual regress summary 
files found at the lowest level of the reporting hierarchy and updates all
the intermediate index.htm files. The reporter tool is expected
to automate the routine maintenance of updating web content to form an
orderly and predictable testing results web that can be reindexed
automatically.
</ul>

<p>A third tool, replacer, is designed to produce a larger number of programs 
that are nearly identical, differing by only a few variables. This program is
ideal for creating regression test suites on APIs or programs that have large 
numbers of variables. It is not explicitly used by the Netscape 
PKCS #11 test suites.

<p>Detailed design specifications for all three testing tools--regress, reporter, and 
replacer--are available at <a href="testtools/toolspecs/">Test Tool Specifications</a>.
