<p>General pointers for getting PKCS #11 drivers
working with Netscape software can be found in
<a href="http://docs.iplanet.com/docs/manuals/security/pkcs/index.htm">
Implementing PKCS #11 for the Netscape Security Library</a> and
the <a target="_top"
href="http://docs.iplanet.com//support/faqs/pkcs_11.html">PKCS #11 FAQ</a>. 

<p>Netscape requires that PKCS #11 implementations comply with version 2.01 or
later of the specification.

<p>The following problems have been encountered by PKCS #11 implementors
getting their code to work with Netscape software:
<ul>
<li>The most common problems have involved the key usage attributes
(CKA_ENCRYPT, CKA_SIGN, etc.).  In general, PKCS #11 implementation vendors
have treated these attributes more strictly than the Netscape library.
Specific problems are:
<ul>
<li>When unwrapping a private key, none of the operation attributes
(<code>CKA_ENCRYPT</code>, <code>CKA_DECRYPT</code>, <code>CKA_UNWRAP</code>,
etc.) is specified, but the library
later tries to use the key for these operations.

<li>When a symmetric key is generated, only the CKA_ENCRYPT operation is
enabled.  The key may nevertheless subsequently be used for decryption.

</ul>

<li>The mutex locks supplied by Netscape and passed into
<code>C_Initialize</code>
are not re-entrant.  That is, if <code>CK_LOCKMUTEX</code> is called on a
mutex that is already locked by the caller, the behavior is undefined (and
will probably cause a crash). This behaviour is defined in section 8.7 of
the spec.

<li>There is a bug in the Netscape security library whereby the
<code>CKA_KEY_TYPE</code>
attribute is not always specified when unwrapping or generating a key.

<li>The Netscape library attempts to set the <code>CKA_LABEL</code> and
<code>CKA_SUBJECT</code>
attributes on private keys after they have been generated, even though
the spec does not require that these attributes be modifiable.

<li>The function list returned by C_GetFunctionList must not contain any
NULL entries.  If a function is not supported, a stub function must be
supplied which returns <code>CKR_FUNCTION_NOT_SUPPORTED</code>. This behavior
is dictated by the 2.01 spec.

<li>In order to support key wrapping and unwrapping, the token must support
padded mechanisms, such as CKM_DES3_CBC_PAD.

<li>If a token is running in FIPS-compliant mode, it may fail some tests
that try to copy a key to the token using C_CreateObject.

<li>PKCS #11 section 7.1 specifies that structs are to be packed to occupy
as little space as possible, meaning they should be packed with 1-byte
alignment.  If the module implementation is compiled with some other
alignment (such as 4-byte), it will not correctly interpret structures
passed from Netscape software.  If the module implementation accesses memory
beyond the proper bounds of the struct, memory faults or other
unpredictable behavior will result.

</ul>
