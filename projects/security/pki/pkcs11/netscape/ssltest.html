<H3>
Purpose</H3>
The SSL test suite uses the regress framework to run a series of test programs
(up to 8000). Each test opens a client and server SSL socket and transfers
data between the two. By default, the suite runs on the communicator internal
crypto library, but it can be configured to run over any PKCS #11 cryptographic
provider.

<H3>
Setting Up the Suite</H3>
To set up the environment for the suite, put <TT>regress</TT>,
<TT>sslt</TT>,
<TT>ssl.reg</TT>,
<TT>cert7.db</TT>,
<TT>key3.db</TT>,
<TT>secmod.db</TT> into a directory.

<H3>
Running the Suite</H3>
The test suite is run like this:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>regress specfile=ssl.reg progress</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
This command will read the specfile, then start running the test program
(<TT>sslt</TT>).

<P>The test suite uses Netscape's PKCS#11 implementation to locate
a certificate with the nickname 'SSLServer' to use as the SSL server
certificate, and a certificate with the nickname 'SSLClient' to use as the
SSL client certificate.

<P>sslt takes at least one argument, the test ID number. This is automatically
provided by regress. However, to facilitate running the suite on other
cryptographic providers, other arguments may be required. You can run individual
tests by simply running sslt with the appropriate test-id. sslt allows
you to specify the nickname to be used for the SSL server and client
certificates with the '-n'  and '-c' options,
and the password/pin protecting the key with the '-p'
option. It's recommended to put these options as the 'globalArgs' parameter
in the [General] section of the ssl.reg file.
<P>We have provided you with keys and certificates in <TT>cert7.db</TT>
and
<TT>key3.db</TT>, so you can try out the suite on the internal Cryptographic
Service Provider. The nicknames of the certificates are 'SSLServer' and
'SSLClient', and the password is 'netscape'. 
<P>Output is provided in a file named according to the date. In the event
of any failures, we recommend running the same test combination with the
internal cryptographic provider.
<P>Please note that the listing of variables in each test in
<TT>ssl.reg</TT>
(the 'testname' line) is for information only. For example, changing SSLVersion3
to NoSSLVersion3 will not actually change the test at all. The 'testname'
information is not transferred to the test. The variables are transferred
to the test by way of the testid number.

<H3>
Generating Your Keys and Certificates on Your Card</H3>

<p>To use the suite with a hardware PKCS #11 solution, you will first need
to use modutil and
certutil (see <a href="../../nss/tools/#Tools">Tools Information</a>)
to make a 2 key pairs
and 2 certificates on your card. You need to make one certificate which
is good for SSL Server, and one for SSL Client auth. Please refer to the
documentation for these tools. The following is an example of the commands
that should be performed:

<PRE>modutil -dbdir . -create
modutil -dbdir . -add "modulename" -libfile
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "c:\windows\driver.dll"
modutil -dbdir . -changepw "tokenname"</PRE>

<PRE>#create server key
certutil -d . -G -n SSLServer -k rsa 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -g 512 -y 65537 -h "tokenname"
certutil -d . -G -n SSLClient -k rsa 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -g 512 -y 65537 -h "tokenname"</pre>

<pre>certutil -d . -S -s "CN=www.domain.com"&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -x -t "Pu,Pu,Pu" -m 1 -n SSLServer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -h tokenname</pre>

<pre>certutil -d . -S -s "CN=xyz"&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -x -t "Pu,Pu,Pu" -m 2 -n SSLClient
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -h tokenname</pre>

The DN of the certificates (the -s parameter to certutil) is ignored by
the suite. The secmod.db, cert7.db and key3.db should be placed into the
same directory as the sslt executable. Edit 'globalArgs' at the start of
ssl.reg to point the suite at your new hardware-based certificates. To indicate
that the certs are on a hardware token, you must specify the token name
in the nickname argument.
<P>&nbsp;For example:
<PRE>[General]
.
.
globalArgs= -n "Hardware Token Name:SSLServer" -c 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hardware Token Name:SSLClient"-p password</PRE>
