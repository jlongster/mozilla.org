<p> This section of the 
   <a href="index.html"> Mozilla CA Certificate Policy </a>
   describes the steps that Mozilla may take in order to 
   enforce this policy. This includes evaluation of security concerns, and 
   removing or disabling a root certificate. 
   </p>

<div class="para">
<p>This is the official Mozilla policy for 
   enforcing the 
   <a href="index.html"> Mozilla CA Certificate Policy: </a>
</p>


<ol>

<li> 
  When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, 
  it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the 
  
    <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/security-bugs-policy.html">
    Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs </a> 
    should be followed. 
    </li>
    
<li> 
   Mozilla may, at its sole discretion, disable or remove a certificate at any 
   time and for any reason. Mozilla will disable or remove a certificate if the 
   CA demonstrates ongoing or egregious practices that do not maintain the 
   level of service that was established in the 
   <a href="InclusionPolicy.html">
    Inclusion Section of the Mozilla CA Certificate Policy
    </a> 
   or that do not comply with the requirements of the 
   <a href="MaintenancePolicy.html">
    Maintenance Section of the Mozilla CA Certificate Policy.
    </a> 
    </li>
    
<li> 
    A certificate is disabled by turning off one or more of the 
    three trust bits (Websites, Email, Code Signing). To initiate the disablement or removal
    of a certificate, a representative of Mozilla will submit a bug report to 
    the mozilla.org Bugzilla system, as described in the 
    <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:Root_Change_Process"> Root Change Process </a>  
    or the
    <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/security-bugs-policy.html">
    Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs. </a> 
   </li>
   
    <li> 
    If Mozilla disables or removes a CA's certificate(s) from Mozilla's 
    products based on a CA's actions (or failure to act) that are contrary 
    to the 
    <a href="index.html"> Mozilla CA Certificate Policy,</a>
    Mozilla shall publicize that fact in newsgroups on the
    news.mozilla.org server, on Web pages in the
    www.mozilla.org and www.mozilla.com domains, in news releases sent 
    to organizations specializing in computer and Internet news, or 
    as an alert to the US-CERT organization of the U.S. Department of 
    Homeland Security.
   </li>

  </ol>

<p>This policy applies only to software products distributed by
Mozilla, including the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiaries. 
Other entities distributing such software are free
to adopt their own policies. In particular, under the terms of the
relevant Mozilla license(s) distributors of such software are
permitted to add or delete CA certificates in the versions that they
distribute, and are also permitted to modify the values of the "trust
bits" on CA certificates in the default CA certificate set. As with
other software modifications, by making such changes a distributor may
affect its ability to use Mozilla trademarks in connection with its
versions of the software; see the <a
href="http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/trademarks">Mozilla trademark
policy</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Please contact Mozilla at <a
href="mailto:certificates@mozilla.org">certificates@mozilla.org</a>
for more information about this policy and answers to related
questions.</p>

<p> We reserve the right to change this policy in the future. We will do so only after consulting with the public Mozilla community, in order to ensure that all views are taken into account. </p>
