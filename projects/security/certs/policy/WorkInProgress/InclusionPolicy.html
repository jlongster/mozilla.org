<p> This section of the 
      <a href="index.html"> Mozilla CA Certificate Policy </a>
      describes the obligations of Certification Authorities 
      applying for inclusion of their root certificates in Mozilla Products. 
      This includes considerations that are taken into account such as the 
      CA's publicly available documentation about their policies, and 
      audits of the CA's operations in support of the documented policies. 
      </p>

<div class="para">
<p>This is the official Mozilla policy for 
   Certification Authorities applying for 
   inclusion of their CA Certificates to be distributed in Mozilla products:
</p>


<ol>

  <li>We will determine which CA certificates are included in software
  products distributed by Mozilla, based on the benefits and
  risks of such inclusion to typical users of those products.</li>

  <li>We will make such decisions through a public process, based on
  objective and verifiable criteria as described below.</li>

  <li>We will not charge any fees to have a CA's certificate(s)
  distributed with our software products.</li>

  <li>
    We reserve the right to not include a particular CA certificate
    in our software products. 
    This includes (but is not limited to) cases where we believe
    that including a CA certificate (or setting its "trust bits" in a
    particular way) would cause undue risks to users' security, for
    example, with CAs that

      <ul>

        <li>knowingly issue certificates without the knowledge of the
        entities whose information is referenced in the certificates;
        <em>or</em></li>

        <li>knowingly issue certificates that appear to be intended
        for fraudulent use.</li>
      </ul>

    This also includes (but again is not limited to) cases where we
    believe that including a CA certificate (or setting its "trust
    bits" in a particular way) might cause technical problems with the
    operation of our software, for example, with CAs that issue
    certificates that have

      <ul>
        <li>ASN.1 DER encoding errors;</li>

        <li>invalid public keys (e.g., DSA certificates with 2048-bit
        primes, or RSA certificates with public exponent equal to
        1);</li>

        <li>duplicate issuer names and serial numbers;</li>

        <li>incorrect extensions (e.g., SSL certificates that exclude
        SSL usage, or authority key IDs that include both the key ID
        and the issuer's issuer name and serial number);
        <em>or</em></li>

        <li>cRLDistributionPoints or OCSP authorityInfoAccess
        extensions for which no operational CRL or OCSP service
        exists.</li>

      </ul>
    </li>

  <li>We will consider adding certificates for additional CAs to the
  default certificate set upon request only
  by an authorized representative of the subject CA.
  </li>

  <li>We require that all CAs whose certificates are distributed with
  our software products:

    <ul>

      <li>provide some service relevant to typical users of our
      software products;</li>

      <li>publicly disclose information about their policies and
      business practices (e.g., in a Certificate Policy and
      Certification Practice Statement);</li>
      
      <li>
      <span style="color:red">
      enforce multi-factor authentication for all accounts capable 
      of directly causing certificate issuance;
      </span>
      </li>

      <li>
      <span style="color:red">
      maintain a certificate hierarchy such that the included certificate 
      signs intermediate certificates for the issuance of end-entity
      certificates to customers;
      </span>
      </li>

      <li>prior to issuing certificates, verify certificate signing
      requests in a manner that we deem acceptable for the stated
      purpose(s) of the certificates;</li>
      
      <li> 
      verify that all of the information that is included in SSL 
      certificates remains current and correct at time intervals of 
      thirty-nine months or less;
      </li>

      <li>otherwise operate in accordance with published criteria that
      we deem acceptable; <em>and</em></li>

      <li>provide public 
      attestation of their conformance to the stated
      verification requirements and other operational criteria by a
      competent independent party or parties with access to details of
      the CA's internal operations.</li>

    </ul></li>

  <li>We consider verification of certificate signing requests to be
  acceptable if it meets or exceeds the following requirements:

    <ul>
      <li> 
      all information that is supplied by the certificate subscriber must 
      be verified by using an independent source of information or an 
      alternative communication channel before it is included in the certificate;
      </li>
      
      <li>for a certificate to be used for digitally signing or
       encrypting email messages, the CA takes reasonable measures to
       verify that the entity submitting the request controls the
       email account associated with the email address referenced in
       the certificate <em>or</em> has been authorized by the email
       account holder to act on the account holder's behalf;</li>

      <li>for a certificate to be used for SSL-enabled servers, the CA
      takes reasonable measures to verify that the entity submitting
      the certificate signing request has registered the domain(s)
      referenced in the certificate <em>or</em> has been authorized
      by the domain registrant to act on the registrant's behalf;</li>

      <li>for certificates to be used for digitally signing code
      objects, the CA takes reasonable measures to verify that the
      entity submitting the certificate signing request is the same
      entity referenced in the certificate <em>or</em> has been
      authorized by the entity referenced in the certificate to act on
      that entity's behalf;</li>

      <li>for certificates to be used for and marked as Extended
      Validation, the CA complies with <cite><a
      href="http://www.cabforum.org/documents.html">Guidelines
      for the Issuance and Management of Extended Validation
      Certificates</a></cite> version 1.2 or later.</li>
    </ul>
    
      We reserve the right to use other requirements in the future.</li>
    
  <li>
  When the CA uses an email challenge-response mechanism to validate that the 
  certificate subscriber has control of the requested domain, the CA must either 
  use a mail system address from the technical or administrative contact information 
  in the domain's WHOIS record, or one formed by prefacing the registered domain with 
  one of the following local parts: admin, administrator, webmaster, hostmaster, 
  or postmaster.
     </li>
     
  <li>
  <span style="color:red">
  The CA must do one of the following for each external third party 
  that issues certificates.
  (Any external third party that can directly cause the issuance of a certificate
  must be treated as a subordinate CA, meeting one of the following two requirements.)
  
  <ul>
      <li> Implement technical controls to restrict the subordinate CA to only issue 
      certificates within a specific set of domain names which the CA has confirmed 
      that the subordinate CA has registered or has been authorized by the domain 
      registrant to act on the registrant's behalf. Such technical controls must be 
      documented in the CA's Certificate Policy or Certification Practice Statement, 
      and reviewed by a competent independent party as part of the CA's annual audit. 
      Acceptable technical controls include but are not limited to X.509 dNSName Name 
      Constraints as specified in RFC 5280, which are marked as critical.
      </li>
      <li> Publicly disclose the subordinate CA along with the subordinate CA's 
      corresponding Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement and 
      provide public attestation of the subordinate CA's conformance to the stated 
      verification requirements and other operational criteria by a competent independent 
      party or parties with access to details of the subordinate CA's internal operations. 
      The subordinate CA's verification requirements and operational criteria must satisfy 
      the requirements of the <a href="index.html"> Mozilla CA Certificate Policy. </a> 
      The CA's Certificate Policy 
      or Certification Practice Statement must indicate where the list of publicly disclosed 
      subordinate CAs may be found on the CA's website.
      </li>
      </ul>
    </span>
    </li>
    
  <li>
  <span style="color:red">
  When an external third party verifies certificate subscriber information on behalf of the CA, the CA must 
  perform appropriate additional due diligence, including at least domain name verification, before the CA may 
  issue the certificate.
      </span>
    </li>
    
  <li>We consider the criteria for CA operations published in any of
  the following documents to be acceptable:

      </ul>

    We reserve the right to accept other criteria in the future.</li>

  <li>By "competent party" we mean a person or other entity who is
  authorized to perform audits according to the stated criteria (e.g.,
  by the organization responsible for the criteria or by a relevant
  government agency) <em>or</em> for whom there is sufficient public
  information available to determine that the party is competent to
  judge the CA's conformance to the stated criteria. In the latter
  case the "public information" referred to should include information
  regarding the party's

    <ul>

      <li>knowledge of CA-related technical issues such as public key
      cryptography and related standards;</li>

      <li>experience in performing security-related audits,
      evaluations, or risk analyses; <em>and</em></li>

      <li>honesty and objectivity.</li>

    </ul></li>

  <li>By "independent party" we mean a person or other entity who is
  not affiliated with the CA as an employee or director <em>and</em>
  for whom at least one of the following statements is true:

    <ul>

      <li>the party is not financially compensated by the CA;</li>

      <li>the nature and amount of the party's financial compensation
       by the CA is publicly disclosed; <em>or</em></li>

      <li>the party is bound by law, government regulation, and/or a
       professional code of ethics to render an honest and objective
       judgement regarding the CA.</li>

    </ul></li>

  <li>We reserve the right to designate our own representative(s) to
  act as the competent independent party or parties described above,
  should that prove to be necessary and appropriate.</li>

  <li>The burden is on the CA to prove that it has met the above
  requirements. However the CA may request a preliminary determination
  from us regarding the acceptability of the criteria and/or the
  competent independent party or parties by which it proposes to meet
  the requirements of this policy.</li>
  
   <li>
   We rely on publicly disclosed documentation 
   (e.g., in a Certificate Policy and Certification Practice Statement)
   and publicly disclosed audit statements 
   to ascertain that the above requirements are met. Therefore,
   inclusion requests will only be considered if the following are true:
    <ul>
      <li>the publicly disclosed documentation 
      provides sufficient information for Mozilla to determine
      whether and how the CA complies with this policy, including
      a description of the steps taken by the CA
      to verify certificate signing requests;
      </li>
      <li>the documentation is available from the CA's official website; and </li>
      <li>the public attestation of the CA's conformance to the stated verification 
      requirements by a competent independent party 
      indicates which policy documents were included in the review. 
      </li>     
    </ul></li>
   
  <li>To request that its certificate(s) be added to the default set a
  CA should submit a formal request by submitting a <a
      href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=mozilla.org&amp;component=CA%20Certificates">bug
      report</a> into the mozilla.org Bugzilla system, filed against the "CA Certificates" component of the
      "mozilla.org" product. 
      
      Mozilla's wiki page,
      <cite><a
      href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:How_to_apply">Applying
      for root inclusion in Mozilla products,</a></cite> 
      provides further details about how to submit a formal request.
      

  The request 
  must be made by an authorized representative of the subject CA, and
  should include the following:

    <ul>

      <li>the certificate data (or links to the data) for the CA
      certificate(s) requested for inclusion;</li>

      <li>for each CA certificate requested for inclusion, whether or
      not the CA issues certificates for each of the following
      purposes within the CA hierarchy associated with the CA
      certificate:

        <ul>
          <li>SSL-enabled servers,</li>

          <li>digitally-signed and/or encrypted email,
          <em>or</em></li>
          <li>digitally-signed executable code objects;</li>
        </ul></li>

      <li>for each CA certificate requested for inclusion, whether the
      CA issues Extended Validation certificates within the CA
      hierarchy associated with the CA certificate <em>and</em>, if
      so, the EV policy OID associated with the CA certificate;</li>

      <li>a Certificate Policy and Certification Practice Statement
      (or links to a CP and CPS) <em>or</em> equivalent disclosure
      document(s) for the CA or CAs in question; <em>and</em></li>

      <li>information as to how the CA has fulfilled the requirements
      stated above regarding its verification of certificate signing
      requests and its conformance to a set of acceptable operational
      criteria.</li></ul>

  We will reject requests where the CA does not provide such
  information within a reasonable period of time after submitting its
  request.</li>

  <li> 
  We have appointed a 
  <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Module_Owners_Activities_Modules#CA_Certificates_Module">
  CA certificate "module owner"</a> 
  and (optionally) one or more "peers" to evaluate CA requests on our behalf 
  and make decisions regarding all matters relating to CA certificates included 
  in our products. CAs or others objecting to a particular decision may appeal to the 
  <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Module_Owners_Activities_Modules#Governance_Module">
  Mozilla governance module owner or peer(s)</a>, who will make a final decision.
</li>
  
  </ol>
