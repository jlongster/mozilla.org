<p>When distributing binary and source code versions of Firefox,
Thunderbird, and other Mozilla-related software products, Mozilla
may
include with such software a default set of X.509v3
certificates for various Certification Authorities (CAs). The
certificates included by default have their "trust bits" set for
various purposes, so that the software in question can use the CA
certificates to verify certificates for SSL servers, S/MIME email
users, and digitally-signed code objects without having to ask users
for further permission or information.</p>

<div class="para">
<p>This is the official Mozilla policy for CA certificates
that are distributed with
Mozilla software products. This policy consists 
of the following three sections:</p>

<ol>

    <li>
    <a href="InclusionPolicy.html">
    Applying for Inclusion of Root Certificates in Mozilla Products
    </a>
    <ul> <li> 
      This section describes the obligations of Certification Authorities 
      applying for inclusion of their root certificates in Mozilla Products. 
      This includes considerations that are taken into account such as the 
      CA's publicly available documentation about their policies, and 
      audits of the CA's operations in support of the documented policies.
      </li> </ul>
    </li>
      
    <li> 
    <a href="MaintenancePolicy.html">
    Maintaining Confidence in Included Root Certificates 
    </a>
    <ul> <li> 
      This section describes the obligations of Certification Authorities 
      for maintaining confidence in their root certificates that are included 
      in Mozilla Products. This includes regular auditing of the CA's policies and practices; 
      conforming to current CA industry standards and recommended best practices;
      and making changes to included root certificates. 
      </li> </ul>
    </li> 
      
    <li> 
    <a href="EnforcementPolicy.html">
    Enforcing the Mozilla CA Certificate Policy
    </a>
    <ul> <li> 
      This section describes the steps that Mozilla may take in order to 
      enforce this policy. This includes evaluation of security concerns, and 
      removing or disabling a root certificate. 
      </li> </ul>
    </li>
      
</ol>

</div>

<p>This policy applies only to software products distributed by
Mozilla, including the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiaries. 
Other entities distributing such software are free
to adopt their own policies. In particular, under the terms of the
relevant Mozilla license(s) distributors of such software are
permitted to add or delete CA certificates in the versions that they
distribute, and are also permitted to modify the values of the "trust
bits" on CA certificates in the default CA certificate set. As with
other software modifications, by making such changes a distributor may
affect its ability to use Mozilla trademarks in connection with its
versions of the software; see the <a
href="http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/trademarks">Mozilla trademark
policy</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Please contact Mozilla at <a
href="mailto:certificates@mozilla.org">certificates@mozilla.org</a>
for more information about this policy and answers to related
questions.</p>

<p> We reserve the right to change this policy in the future. We will do so only after consulting with the public Mozilla community, in order to ensure that all views are taken into account. </p>
