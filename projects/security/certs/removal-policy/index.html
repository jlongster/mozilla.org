<p>When distributing binary and source code versions of Firefox,
Thunderbird, and other Mozilla-related software products the Mozilla
Foundation and its wholly-owned subsidiary the Mozilla Corporation
include with such software a default set of X.509v3
certificates for various Certification Authorities (CAs). The
certificates included by default have their "trust bits" set for
various purposes, so that the software in question can use the CA
certificates to verify certificates for SSL servers, S/MIME email
users, and digitally-signed code objects without having to ask users
for further permission or information.</p>

<div class="para">
<p>This is the work-in-progress to create an official Mozilla Foundation 
policy for the deprecation and removal of CA certificates from software products that the 
Mozilla Foundation and Mozilla Corporation distribute</p>

<ol>

  <li>
    We reserve the right to remove a particular CA
    certificate from our products, <em>or</em> to modify the "trust
    bits" for a particular CA certificate included in our products, at
    any time and for any reason.

    This includes (but is not limited to) cases where we believe
    that continuing to include a CA certificate (or setting its "trust bits" in a
    particular way) would cause undue risks to users' security, for
    example, with CAs that

      <ul>

        <li>knowingly issue certificates without the knowledge of the
        entities whose information is referenced in the certificates;
        <em>or</em></li>

        <li>knowingly issue certificates that appear to be intended
        for fraudulent use.</li>

        <li>have not provided evidence to Mozilla of a recent audit satisfying 
        sections 8, 9, and 10 of the 
        <a
         href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/policy/">Mozilla CA Policy.</a>
        </li>
      </ul>

    This also includes (but again is not limited to) cases where we
    believe that continuing to include a CA certificate (or setting its "trust
    bits" in a particular way) might cause technical problems with the
    operation of our software, for example, with CAs that issue
    certificates that have

      <ul>
        <li>ASN.1 DER encoding errors;</li>

        <li>invalid public keys (e.g., DSA certificates with 2048-bit
        primes, or RSA certificates with public exponent equal to
        1);</li>

        <li>duplicate issuer names and serial numbers;</li>

        <li>incorrect extensions (e.g., SSL certificates that exclude
        SSL usage, or authority key IDs that include both the key ID
        and the issuer's issuer name and serial number);
        <em>or</em></li>

        <li>cRLDistributionPoints or OCSP authorityInfoAccess
        extensions for which no operational CRL or OCSP service
        exists.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

  <li>
    We reserve the right to remove a particular CA certificate from our products
    when we believe that attacks on roots with older signature algorithms or smaller key 
    lengths are imminent and/or readily repeatable. For example, CAs using
      <ul>
        <li>MD2, MD4, MD5, or SHA1 signature algorithms</li>
        <li>Key lengths of 1024 bit or smaller</li>
      </ul>
    In these situations we will follow this process:
      <ul>
        <li>Assess root certificates in Mozilla products for vulnerability 
         to the specific attack.</li>
        <li>Attempt to contact affected CAs and inform them of the attack and its 
         projected consequences for their root certificates. Likely this will include 
         information on our intention to remove affected root certificates from 
         distribution, and the tentative schedule to do so. Communication may be done by posting 
         to a Mozilla newsgroup and/or sending an email to the affected CAs. 
         Note: If we do not receive a response from an affected CA within 48 hours of our 
         communication, we may make the assumption of disinterest, and remove the affected 
         root certificate(s) without further notification.</li>
        <li>Remove all affected root certificates from distribution within a short time frame, 
         and distribute a mandatory security update.</li>
       </ul>
    </li>

  <li>We will determine which CA certificates may be removed from software 
      products distributed through mozilla.org, based on the benefits and 
      risks of such removal to typical users of those products.</li>

  <li>We will determine which "trust bits" may be unset for CA 
      certificates distributed through mozilla.org, based on the benefits and 
      risks of the "trust bit" settings to typical users of those products.</li>

  <li>We will make such decisions through a public process, based on
      objective and verifiable criteria as described below.</li>

  <li>We will not charge any fees to have a CA's certificate(s)
      removed from our software products.</li>

  <li>We will consider deprecating a CA certificate by unsetting one or more of the
      "trust bits" upon request for the following reasons
    <ul>
      <li>Expired or Expiring CA</li>
      <li>Small modulus key length</li>
      <li>Outdated signing key algorithm</li>
      <li>Transition/Rollover to new root completed</li>
      <li>Legacy, no longer in use</li>
      <li>We reserve the right to use other considerations in the future.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>

  <li>We will consider removing a CA certificate upon request for the following reasons

    <ul>
      <li>Security Compromise</li>
      <li>Small modulus key length</li>
      <li>Outdated signing key algorithm</li>
      <li>Previously deprecated</li>
      <li>We reserve the right to use other considerations in the future.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>

  <li>We require that all CAs whose certificates are to be deprecated or removed from 
      our software products:

    <ul>
      <li>Provide the reason for requesting deprecation or removal of the 
         root certificate.</li>
      <li>Publicly disclose the impact that deprecating or removing the 
         root certificate may have on Mozilla users. </li>
      <li>Prior to deprecating or removing the CA certificate, confirm that 
       appropriate notification has been provided to users who may be negatively impacted.</li>
    </ul></li>

  <li>The burden is on the CA to prove that it has met the above
  requirements. </li>

  <li>To request that its certificate(s) be deprecated (one or more of the "trust bits" unset) 
      or removed from the default set a CA should submit a formal request by submitting a <a
      href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=mozilla.org&amp;component=CA%20Certificates">bug
      report</a> into the mozilla.org Bugzilla system, filed against the "CA Certificates" component of the
      "mozilla.org" product.

  The request should include the following:

    <ul>

      <li>The certificate data identifying the root certificate(s) 
      to be deprecated or removed.</li>

      <li>For each CA certificate requested to be removed, 
      the reason that the certificate is to be removed.</li>

      <li>For each CA certificate requested to be deprecated
      the reason that the certificate is to be deprecated, and
      a recommendation as to which "trust bits" should be unset.</li>

      <li>For each CA certificate requested to be deprecated or removed, the impact that
      deprecation or removal may have on Mozilla users. </li>

      <li>Information as to how the CA will ensure that deprecation or removal of the 
          certificate will not cause users technical problems with the 
          operation of our software.</li></ul>

  We will reject requests where the CA does not provide such
  information within a reasonable period of time after submitting its
  request.</li>

  <li>We will appoint a CA certificate "module owner" to evaluate CA
      requests on our behalf and make decisions regarding all matters
      relating to deprecating or removing CA certificates from our products. CAs or
      others objecting to a particular decision may appeal to
      mozilla.org staff, who will make a final decision.</li>

  <li>We reserve the right to change this policy in the future. We
  will do so only after consulting with the public Mozilla community,
  in order to ensure that all views are taken into account.</li></ol>

<p>This policy applies only to software products distributed by the
Mozilla Foundation and the Mozilla Corporation; other entities
distributing such software are free
to adopt their own policies. In particular, under the terms of the
relevant Mozilla license(s) distributors of such software are
permitted to add or delete CA certificates in the versions that they
distribute, and are also permitted to modify the values of the "trust
bits" on CA certificates in the default CA certificate set. As with
other software modifications, by making such changes a distributor may
affect its ability to use Mozilla trademarks in connection with its
versions of the software; see the <a
href="http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/trademarks">Mozilla trademark
policy</a> for more information.</p>
