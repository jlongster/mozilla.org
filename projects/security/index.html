<p>Mozilla includes several projects related to security:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="pki/">Open Source PKI Projects</a>. Main home page for all 
open source <dfn>public-key infrastructure (PKI)</dfn> projects, including:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="pki/nss/"><dfn>Network Security Services (NSS)</dfn></a>. Project 
for supporting cross-platform development of security-enabled server applications. 
Applications built with NSS can support PKCS #5, PKCS #7, PKCS #11, PKCS #12, 
S/MIME, TLS, SSL v2 and v3, X.509 v3 certificates, and other security standards.</li>
    <li><a href="pki/jss/"><dfn>Network Security Services for Java (JSS)</dfn></a>. 
A Java interface to NSS that supports most of the security standards and encryption 
technologies supported by NSS. JSS also provides a pure Java interface for ASN.1 
types and BER/DER encoding.</li>
    <li><a href="pki/python-nss/"><dfn>Python Binding for NSS (python-nss)</dfn></a>. 
A Python language binding for NSS and NSPR which provides a Python programmer access
to the NSS and NSPR API suite in a programmer friendly "Pythonic" manner.</li>
    <li><a href="pki/psm/"><dfn>Personal Security Manager (PSM)</dfn></a>. Project 
for supporting cross-platform development of security-enabled client applications. 
PSM includes libraries (built on top of NSS) and a daemon that performs 
cryptographic operations on behalf of a client application -- operations such as 
setting up an SSL connection, object signing and signature verification, certificate 
management, and other common PKI functions.</li>
    <li><a href="pki/pkcs11/">PKCS #11 Conformance Testing</a>. Test suites designed to 
test PKCS #11 implementations.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="certs/">X.509 v3 Certificate Store</a>. NSS ships by default with a set of root certificates. This page details how this store is managed.</li>
  <li><a href="components/">Component Security For Mozilla</a>. Project 
for adding Java and JavaScript security to Mozilla components, mainly in terms of mobile code 
and the browser interfaces available to programs from those languages.</li>
  <li><a href="security-bugs-policy.html">Policy for Handling Security Bugs</a>. Guidelines
on how to report security vulnerabilities and how the Mozilla community will deal with them.
  <ul>
    <li><a href="secgrouplist.html">Current Members</a> of the Mozilla security group.</li>
    <li><a href="known-vulnerabilities.html">Known Vulnerabilities</a>. List of known
security weaknesses in various versions of Mozilla.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="tld-idn-policy-list.html">Top Level Domains for which we permit Internationalized Domain Names</a>, with links to the relevant registry policies.</li>
</ul>
