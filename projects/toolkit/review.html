<h3>General Notes</h3>
<p>This document covers all patches to the mozilla/toolkit, mozilla/chrome,
and mozilla/xulrunner hierarchies. For questions or concerns arising
from this document, please direct questions to the dev-planning mailing
list/newsgroup.</p>
<p>Code in the mozilla/browser hierarchy is covered by the
<a href="/projects/firefox/review.html">Firefox reviewers</a>.</p>

<h3>Toolkit Peers and Sub-modules</h3>

<p>The list of current peers and sub-module owners and peers is maintained in the
   <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Modules/Toolkit">module owners list</a></p>
<p>Note: the code in toolkit/components/places is owned by the
   <a href="../firefox/review.html">Firefox team</a>. It lives in the toolkit/
   directory so that it is correctly linked.</p>

<h3>Review Rules</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Unless there are extenuating circumstances, patches in a certain area
      should be reviewed by one of the listed sub-module owners or reviewers.</li>
  <li>Peers may grant review in any area covered by toolkit, provided they
      feel confident in their knowledge of the code being changed.</li>
  <li>Sub-module peers may only grant review in the listed sub-module</li>
  <li>Peers or sub-module owners may delegate review of a patch they would
      normally be able to review to anyone else they think would be
      appropriate</li>
  <li>One review is sufficient in most cases. If the first reviewer
      feels that the patch would benefit from additional reviews, they 
      should request a second review from an appropriate person.</li>
  <li>Super-review is required where required by the mozilla.org
      <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/hacking/reviewers.html">super-review 
      policy</a>.</li>
  <li>Significant UI changes should get UI review from someone
      in the UI group, as well as review from an appropriate code reviewer.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Unit-Test Rules</h3>

<ul>
  <li>All patches must include <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/Mozilla_automated_testing">
      automated tests</a> where practical. Once automated tests are committed,
      the <tt>in-testsuite+</tt> flag should be set on the bug.</li>
  <li>Automated tests must be included in patches and reviewed just like any
      other code.</li>
  <li>If it is not practical to create an automated test for a bug then the
      <tt>in-testsuite-</tt> flag should be set and the developer must work with
      the QA team to determine whether a manual testcase must be developed.</li>
</ul>
