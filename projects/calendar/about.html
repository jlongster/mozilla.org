  Philipp initially found interest in the project during one of many QA
  testdays. That not being enough he looked for a way to contribute code 
  to the project. Preferring to work with back-end code, he started working 
  with the Google Calendar API seeking to integrate it with the calendar 
  project. In 2009 he was appointed as the Calendar Project lead and is 
  now employed at Mozilla. In his remaining time he studies 
  computer science at the University of Applied Science in Wedel, Germany.

  Mark designed the Sunbird logo and along with Chris Cook (and a lot of
  community input) created the default theme for Sunbird. His follow-on

  the default Firefox  theme. He is currently designated as the
  responsible party for Sunbird graphics (logo, icons, etc.).

  His "day job" has very little to do with graphics. Outside of making an
  odd logo or some icons for business or personal projects, he works as
  a software engineering consultant and develops web-based applications.
  He has lived in Hawaii for over a quarter of a century and has been

  He has also contributed some patches, but since he really can't code,
  his contributions to the codebase are small and mostly trivial. He
  became involved with the project when Sunbird was announced back in 2003.
  Before that he was a major contributor to the Firefox QA team. In his
  real life Simon works as a management consultant in Germany.
