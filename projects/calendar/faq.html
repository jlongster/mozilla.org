<h2>The Answers</h2>

<h3><a id="GENERAL" href="#GENERAL.toc">General</a></h3>
<dl>
  <dt id="difference">What's the difference between Sunbird and Lightning?</dt>
  <dd>
   <p><a href="sunbird/index.html">Sunbird</a> is our standalone calendar
   application. It doesn't need another client application to run at the
   cost of a larger download and higher memory requirements. Because of
   its standalone nature, Sunbird does not offer any kind of tight
   integration with an e-mail application, such as
   <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird/">Mozilla Thunderbird</a>.</p>
   <p><a href="lightning/index.html">Lightning</a> is a calendar extension for
   <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird/">Mozilla Thunderbird</a>.
   It offers calendaring features directly in the Thunderbird User Interface.
   Further integration features, such as e-mail invites or address book
   integration are planned for future releases.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt id="install_info">What do I need to install Lightning?</dt>
  <dd>You need a current version of Thunderbird, either 2.0 or higher.
   There are also Lightning versions for the latest nightly releases.
   Take a look at the <a href="lightning/download.html">Lightning download
   page</a>. If there is trouble, try installing Lightning before any other
   extensions.
  </dd>
  
  <dt id="install_bit">Why is Lightning not compatible with my Thunderbird build type?</dt>
  <dd>If you are using the 64-bit version of Thunderbird and you can't install
  Lightning because it's not compatible with your Thunderbird build type (Linux_x86_64-gcc3),
  you need to download the 64-bit version of Lightning. You can find the latest
  64-bit build for Thunderbird 3.1 <a href="http://releases.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/calendar/lightning/releases/1.0b2/contrib/linux-x86_64/">here</a>.
  </dd>

  <dt id="uninstall_info">How do I uninstall Lightning?</dt>
  <dd>
   You can uninstall Lightning from the Extensions Manager in the Tools menu.
  </dd>

  <dt id="nightly_builds">Are nightly builds safe?</dt>
  <dd>Nightly builds are test builds for developers. They are not intended
   for general use. Using nightly builds can result in crashes and loss of data.
  </dd>
  
   <dt id="sunbird_release">When will Sunbird 1.0 be released?</dt>
  <dd>The development of Sunbird has been discontinued and thus, we unfortunately
  won't release any new versions of it.
  If you are still using Sunbird, you might consider to switch to <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/lightning/">Lightning</a>.

  <dt id="holidays">Is there a holiday feature of some kind?</dt>
  <dd>You can subscribe to <a href="holidays.html">holiday files</a>.</dd>

  <dt id="twelve_months">How can I make a recurring event on, say,
   the first Monday every August?</dt>
  <dd>Set the event to repeat every 12 months: In the new event dialog, set
   the start date to the first Monday of August of the first year, say
   2000-08-07. Click the recurrence tab, check "Repeat every", set interval
   to <kbd>12</kbd>, set unit to "Months", then click "First Monday of the
   month".
  </dd>

  <dt id="remote_server">How can I publish my events on a remote server?</dt>
  <dd>
   <p>
    You can create your calendar on a calendar server that supports 
    <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Calendar:QA_CalDAV_Support">CalDAV</a>, or 
    <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Calendar:WCAP_Guide">WCAP</a>, or has a 
    <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/sunbird/browse/type:1/cat:75?show=20&amp;exp=on&amp;sort=popular">calendar 
    data provider add-on</a>.<br>
    CalDAV, WCAP, and some add-on protocols permit a calendaring client such as 
    Sunbird or Lightning to tell the server to modify individual events, and 
    the servers prevent or detect overwriting changes by two people or programs. 
    When you subscribe to a calendar using these methods, changes you make
    are saved back to the server one event or task at a time.
   </p>
   <p>
    You can also publish events from the calendar as a personal .ics file on an 
    FTP server (Sunbird only) or a webDAV enabled web server. You can use 
    the calendar to subscribe to these events as well.
    Since this method overwrites the entire file for each change, 
    it is not for calendars modified by more than one person or program, nor
    for large calendars.
   </p>
  </dd>

  <dt id="share">How can I serve my shared calendars?</dt>
  <dd>
   <p>
    One way is to store your calendar on a public calendar service. There are 
    many; check with your email provider, or search the web. Some store only 
    whole ics files modified by a single user, while others provide a service 
    with a more robust calendaring protocol such as CalDAV (or WCAP), to 
    better handle large calendars and changes by multiple users.    
   </p>
   <p>
    To serve shared calendars from your own server machine, the best way is to
    install a service specifically designed to manage calendars, typically using 
    a protocol such as <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Calendar:QA_CalDAV_Support">CalDAV</a>, 
    or <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Calendar:WCAP_Guide">WCAP</a>. Both 
    open source and commercially supported calendar service software packages 
    are available. 
   </p>
   <p>
    If only one person or program will modify a small calendar, you can use a 
    <a href="http://www.webdav.org">webDAV server</a>. If you run your own web 
    server, you can install <a href="http://www.webdav.org/mod_dav">mod_dav</a>, 
    a free Apache module that will turn your web server into a webDAV server. 
    Instructions on how to set it up are on their website. Once you set up your 
    webDAV server, you can publish your calendar to the site, then subscribe to 
    it from any other Calendar. Automatically updating the calendar will give 
    you a poor man's calendar server.

  <dt id="to_tray">Can Sunbird/Lightning remind me when closed? Can Sunbird start minimized?</dt>
  <dd>No, Sunbird and Lightning can't give pop-up messages or send e-mails when
   they are not running. There is a 'trick' for this problem. You can hide
   Sunbird in the tray. This can be done with
   <a href="http://users.dart.net.au/~srgeorg/">Suntray</a> or
   <a href="http://minimizetotray.mozdev.org/">Minimize to Tray</a> for Windows
   and <a href="http://kdocker.sourceforge.net">Kdocker</a> for Linux.

<h3><a id="INTERCHANGE" href="#INTERCHANGE.toc">Import, Export</a></h3>

<dl>
  <dt id="format">What is the file format for Sunbird or Lightning?</dt>
  <dd>
   <p>Sunbird/Lightning uses a SQL-based storage mechanism based on
   <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>. Local calendar files have the
   file suffix <strong>.sdb</strong> and can be found in the profile directory.</p>
   <p>Sunbird/Lightning can also work with files based on the
   <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2445.txt">iCal standard</a>. These
   files have the <strong>.ics</strong> file suffix and can be opened,
   imported, exported and subscribed to.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt id="outlook">Will it work with Outlook?</dt>
  <dd>Outlook does not store its calendar data in an open standard format, so
   Calendar and Sunbird currently do not support Outlook directly. However, you may
   be able to export your Outlook events as an .ics or .csv file, and import them
   into Sunbird or Lightning using the "Calendar Files" or "Outlook Comma Separated"
   file type, respectively. Linux users may find
   <a href="http://outport.sourceforge.net/">this page of some use</a>. (Follow
   <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167102">bug 167102</a> for
   more details on Outlook integration)
  </dd>

  <dt id="wcap">Will it work with Sun's calendar server?</dt>
  <dd>In the <code>New Calendar</code> dialog select <code>On the
   Network</code> and then the <code>WCAP</code> calendar type.
   Provide a URL of the calendar server of the form
   <code>https://<em>servername.com</em>/</code> or
   <code>https://<em>username</em>@<em>servername.com</em>/</code>
   in the <code>Location</code> field. See also the
   <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Calendar:WCAP_Guide">WCAP Guide</a>.
  </dd>

  <dt id="apple">Does it work with Apple's iCal?</dt>
  <dd>iCal and Calendar use the same file format, so events from one should
   show up without problem in the other. You can also subscribe to the
   <a href="http://www.apple.com/ical/library/">list of events on Apple's
   website</a> if you like.
   <p></p>
   Please note that iCal is currently not capable of cooperatively editing a
   calendar file on a webDAV or ftp server. iCal will overwrite any changes
   made from a different application (like Sunbird or Lightning) on such a
   file.
  </dd>

  <dt id="palm">Does it sync with my Palm Pilot?</dt>
  <dd>Calendar does not yet sync with your Palm Pilot.</dd>

  <dt id="importing">Why doesn't it show any events when importing a calendar file?<br>
   (It seems to be importing all the items but doesn't show any events.)</dt>
  <dd>Sounds like your default calendar might be set to not visible (in the
   Calendars tab). There is a
   <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=237311">bug</a> that
   sets a non-visible calendar to visible for a short time while adding a new
   event to that calendar. The events are drawn to view during that time, but
   when you click one of the events the calendar is not available, and a crash
   results.<br>
   In short, check if your default calendar is visible.

<h3><a id="CONFIGURE" href="#CONFIGURE.toc">Configure/Customize</a></h3>

<dl>
  <dt id="date_format">How can I change the date format?</dt>
  <dd>
   <p>The Long date format and Short date format are defined by the local
   operating system so date formats are consistent across the screen.</p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      In windows, see Start | Settings | Control Panel | Regional Options |
      Date (tab)
     </li>
    </ul>
   <p>You can choose between the Long date format or Short date format in the
   calendar preferences to control how dates appear in tables and exported text.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt id="alarm_sound">How can I change the calendar alarm sound?</dt>
  <dd>It is packed in the calendar.jar file in your applications chrome directory.
   The filename is sound.wav. You have to unpack calendar.jar with a zip program
   (like WinZip), change sound.wav and repack it.
  </dd>

  <dt id="colors">How can I Color Events?</dt>
  <dd>You can create calendar files for different kinds of events and give each
   file a different color.</dd>

  <dt id="local_calendar">
   How can I access Local Calendar(s) from Sunbird or Lightning at the same time?
  </dt>
  <dd>
   <p><em>Sunbird:</em> Use <code>File | New Calendar...</code> to create a new local file
   in one program, and <code>File | Open Calendar File</code> to open the
   same local file from the other program.</p>
   
   <p><em>Lightning:</em> Use <code>File | New | Calendar...</code> to create a new local file
   in one program, and <code>File | Open | Calendar File...</code> to open the
   same local file from the other program.</p>
   
   <p>This is intended for viewing the same local calendar from two programs,
   not for editing a shared calendar.  Be careful not to add or edit any
   events or tasks in the same calendar file from two program instances
   simultaneously, or you may lose changes when the file is overwritten.
   (If you must live dangerously, refresh before editing.)</p>
   <p>An example in more detail:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>
     Create a local calendar within the first program, say Lightning.
     <ol class="upper-roman">
      <li>To create a new local file, by using a <code>file://</code> URL:
       <ol class="upper-alpha">
        <li>
         From the <code>File</code> menu,
         choose <code>New | Calendar...</code>
         <ol class="lower-alpha">
          <li>
           Select <code>On the Network...</code>, and click <code>Next</code><br/>
           (<b>Not</b> <code>On My Computer</code>,
           which creates calendars stored in a local SQLite database.)
          </li>
          <li>
           Select <code>iCalendar (ICS)</code> (default), and enter a file:
           URL to the local file.<br/>
           On MS-Windows operating systems it may be something like:<br/>
           <cite><code>file:///c:/Documents and Settings/USERNAME/MyCal.ics</code></cite>
           Click <code>Next</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
           Edit the name and color if desired.<br/>
           Click <code>Next</code>.

         </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
         In the left sidebar, the calendar is added to the Calendar list
         (click '+' if it is collapsed), but the MyCal.ics file won't
         appear on disk until you add an event or task to it.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li>To add an event:
       <ol class="upper-alpha">
        <li>
         In the <code>Calendar</code> list, click to select the new calendar
         <code>MyCal</code> so just its line is on a different color background.
         (The checkbox should remain on.)
        </li>
        <li>
         To add a new event, click the <code>New Event</code> toolbar button<br/>
         (or in the <code>File</code> menu, click <code>New</code> &gt; <code>Event...</code>).
        </li>
        <li>
         In the event dialog, enter a title, say <code>My Lunch</code>.<br/>
         Click <code>ok</code> to save it.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
       To verify where the calendar is stored: In the <code>Calendar</code>
       list, click-right on the calendar name <code>MyCal.ics</code> and
       click <code>Properties</code>.  Note the location file path.  Click
       <code>ok</code>.

       a text editor to check that an event with the title
       <code>My Lunch</code> has been added to that file.
      </li>
     </ol>

 <dd>
  Yes, of course! We'll still help you if you have problems with Sunbird 1.0 beta 1.
  If you need help with Sunbird 0.9, it's very likely that upgrading to the latest version will
  fix your problem. If you aren't able to upgrade, we're sorry to say that the support
  for 0.9 will cease. That also applies to all nightly builds.
