DESCRIPTION:National statutory holiday.  \"Boxing Day\" is listed in the 
 Canada Labour Code as a holiday.\n\nThe day after Christmas\, the Feast 
 of St. Stephen\, the first Christian martyr\, is better known as Boxing 
 Day.  The term may come from the opening of church poor boxes that day\; 
 maybe from the earthenware boxes with which boy apprentices collected 
 money at the doors of their masters' clients.\n\nNowadays\, we often 
 see\, in certain families\, gifts (boxes) given to those who provide 
 services throughout the year.\n

DESCRIPTION:National statutory holiday.  The Sovereign's birthday has 
 been celebrated in Canada since the reign of Queen Victoria (1837-1901). 
 \n\nMay 24\, Queen Victoria's birthday\, was declared a holiday by the 
 Legislature of the Province of Canada in 1845.\n\nAfter Confederation\, 
 the Queen's birthday was celebrated every year on May 24 unless that date 
 was a Sunday\, in which case a proclamation was issued providing for the 
 celebration on May 25.\n\nAfter the death of Queen Victoria in 1901\, an 
 Act was passed by the Parliament of Canada establishing a legal holiday 
 on May 24 in each year (or May 25 if May 24 fell on a Sunday) under the 
 name Victoria Day.\n\nThe birthday of King Edward VII\, who was born on 
 November 9\, was by yearly proclamation during his reign (1901-1910) 
 celebrated on Victoria Day.\n\nIt was not an innovation to celebrate the 
 birthday of the reigning sovereign on the anniversary of the birth of a 
 predecessor.  In Great Britain\, the birthdays of George IV (1820-1830) 
 and William IV (1830-1837) were celebrated on June 4\, birthday of George 
 III (1760-1820).\n\nThe birthday of King George V\, who reigned from 1910 
 to 1935\, was celebrated on the actual date\, June 3 or\, when that was a 
 Sunday\, by proclamation on June 4.\n\nThe one birthday of King Edward 
 VIII\, who reigned in 1936\, was also celebrated on the actual date\, 
 June 23.\n\nKing George VI's birthday\, which fell on December 14\, was 
 officially celebrated in the United Kingdom on a Thursday early in June.  
 Up to 1947 Canada proclaimed the same day but in 1948 and further years 
 settled on the Monday of the week in which the United Kingdom celebration 
 took place.  George VI reigned from 1936 to 1952.\n\nThe first birthday 
 of Queen Elizabeth II\, in 1952\, was also celebrated in 
 June.\n\nMeanwhile\, Canada continued to observe Victoria Day.  An 
 amendment to the Statutes of Canada in 1952 established the celebration 
 of Victoria Day on the Monday preceding May 25.\n\nFrom 1953 to 1956\, 
 the Queen's birthday was celebrated in Canada on Victoria Day\, by 
 proclamation of the Governor General\, with Her Majesty's approval.  In 
 1957\, Victoria Day was permanently appointed as the Queen's birthday in 
 Canada (in the United Kingdom\, the Queen's birthday is celebrated in 
 June).\n\nComputation:  Falls on the Monday on or before May 24 every 
 year.\nCategory:  Public holiday\n

DESCRIPTION:Declaration:\n\nAt the stroke of noon on February 15\, 1965\, 
 Canada's red and white maple leaf flag was raised for the very first 
 time. \n\nThe flag belongs to all Canadians\; it is an emblem we all 
 share.\n\nAlthough simple in design\, Canada's flag well reflects the 
 common values we hold so dear:  freedom\, peace\, respect\, justice and 
 tolerance. Canada's flag is a symbol that unites Canadians and expresses 
 throughout the world and always our pride in being Canadian.\n\nThe maple 
 leaf flag pays homage to our geography\, reflects the grandeur of our 
 history and represents our national identity.\n\nOur flag thus honours 
 Canadians of all origins who through their courage and determination\, 
 have helped to build and are continuing to build our great country:  a 
 dynamic country that is open to the future.\n\nTherefore\, I\, Jean 
 Chrétien\, Prime Minister of Canada\, declare that February 15 will be 
 celebrated henceforth as National Flag of Canada Day.\n\nLet us be proud 
 of our flag!  Let us recognize how privileged we are to live in Canada\, 
 this magnificent country that encompasses our history\, our hopes\, our 
 future.\n\nJean Chrétien\,\nPrime Minister of Canada February 15\, 
 1996.\n
