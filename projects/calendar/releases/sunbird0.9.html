  <h2 id="downloadandinstall">Downloading and Installing</h2>

  <h3 id="requirements">System Requirements</h3>
  <p>Before installing, make sure your computer meets the
   <a href="../sunbird/system-requirements.html">system requirements</a>. Mac
   OS X users must have Mac OS X 10.2 or greater, and Windows users must have
   Windows XP or later.</p>
  <p>Windows releases prior to Windows XP are working but may display event times 
   erroneously due to outdated timezone on the operating system level. This can 
   be fixed using unofficial patches. Users should read the 
   <a href="#issues-windows">known issues</a> section for more information.</p>

  <h3 id="downloading"><a>Downloading Sunbird 0.9</a></h3>

  <p>Mozilla.org provides Sunbird for Windows, Linux, Solaris, and Mac OS X 
   in a variety of languages. To get Sunbird 0.9,
   <a href="../sunbird/download.html">download it here</a>.</p>

  <p>For builds for other systems and languages not provided, see the
   <a href="#contributedbuilds">Contributed Builds</a> section at the end of
   this document.</p>

  <h3 id="install"><a>Installing Sunbird</a></h3>
  <p>Once you have downloaded Sunbird, follow these instructions to install:</p>

  <h4>Windows</h4>
  <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Install the updated timezones for Windows.
   Information on obtaining the updated timezones can be found in
   <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/955839/">Microsoft Knowledge Base
   article 955839</a>.<br>
   <strong>Not updating your Windows timezones will result in unreliable and
   erroneous display and entry of time data! Be sure to do this!</strong></p>

  <p>Before installing, uninstall any previous versions of Sunbird you may
   have. From the <kbd>Start</kbd> menu, choose <kbd>Control Panel</kbd>. When
   the Control Panel appears, double click <kbd>Add/Remove Programs</kbd>.
   Select "Mozilla Sunbird" in the list and click <kbd>Remove</kbd>to uninstall.</p>
  <p>Then, double click the installer to start the install.</p>

  <h4>Mac OS X</h4>
  <p>Once you have downloaded the <code>sunbird-0.8.en-US.mac.dmg</code>
   file, double click the Sunbird Disk Image to open it in Finder, and then
   drag the Sunbird application onto your hard disk. Drag the icon to your
   Dock if you want it to appear there.</p>

  <h4>Linux/GTK2 and Solaris/GTK2</h4>
  <p>Extract the tarball in the directory where you want to install Sunbird:</p>
  <p><code>tar -xzvf sunbird-0.8.en-US.linux-i686.tar.gz</code></p>

  <p>This will create a <code>sunbird</code> subdirectory of that directory.</p>

  <h3>Other Platforms</h3>
  <p>Extract the compressed archive and run <code>sunbird</code>.</p>

  <h3 id="uninstall">Uninstalling Sunbird</h3>

  <p>To uninstall Sunbird, follow these instructions:</p>
  <h3>Windows</h3>
  <p>From the <kbd>Start</kbd> menu, choose <kbd>Control Panel</kbd>. When the
   Control Panel appears, double click <kbd>Add/Remove Programs</kbd>. Find
   "Mozilla Sunbird (0.9)" in the list and click <kbd>Remove</kbd> to uninstall.</p>

  <h3>Mac OS X</h3>
  <p>Drag the <code>Sunbird</code> application to the Trash.</p>

  <h3>Others</h3>
  <p>Remove the <code>sunbird</code> folder.</p>

  <p>These instructions leave your profile in place in case you install
   Sunbird again in the future. If you wish to remove your profile folder,
   remove the location described below in the <strong>"Profile Folder"</strong>
   section. Note that by doing this you are destroying all of your calendars,
   saved passwords, settings and other information and should you decide to
   use Sunbird again you will be starting with a clean profile.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h2>Other Information</h2>
  <h3 id="profilefolder">Profile Folder</h3>
  <p>Sunbird stores your user data in one of the following locations:</p>

  <table style="font-size: smaller; text-align: left;">

  </table>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h2 id="issues"><a>Known Issues</a></h2>
  <p>This list covers some of the known issues with Sunbird 0.9.</p>

  <h3 id="issues-all">All Systems</h3>
  <ul>
   <li>Sunbird 0.9 will attempt to guess your timezone on startup. As this
    is only a best guess, you <strong>must</strong> manually set the timezone
    in the Preferences/Options dialog before entering data. Not doing so may
    cause events to appear at the wrong time</li>
   <li>The <strong>experimental</strong> support for viewing remote calendars 
    offline has various known issues in the area of performance and calendar 
    data display. It does not support the offline editing of events and tasks</li>
   <li>It is impossible to load several calendars with different passwords on
    the same server
    (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=247486">bug 247486</a>)</li>
   <li>"By weekday" and "by day" recurrence types (such as "recur on the last
    weekday of the month") are not supported
    (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=322458">bug 322458</a>)</li>
    <li>Concurrent editing of remote calendars by multiple users can lose data
    (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=329570">bug 329570</a>)</li>
   <li>There are intermittent issues when modifying occurrences of recurring
    events via Copy/Paste
    (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=354578">bug 354578</a>)</li>
   <li>Under some instances the "Do you want to save your changes" dialog does
    not come up when editing events in the event dialog
    (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=364387">bug 364387</a>)</li>
   <li>Due to the complexity of the Daylight Savings Time rules for the
    /Asia/Jerusalem timezone, .ICS files which contain events in the
    /Asia/Jerusalem timezone may fail to import into Microsoft Outlook 2003
    (as well as earlier versions). These files should import successfully into
    Microsoft Outlook 2007
    (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=367378">bug 367378</a>)</li>
   <li>Events deleted in Sunbird will not be deleted on a OpenXchange server
   unless "enabledelete=yes" is added as a GET parameter
    (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=369076#c3">bug 369076</a>)</li>
   <li>Multiple windows of the same single event can be opened from the Agenda,
    the task list and the unifinder
    (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=373251">bug 373251</a>)</li>
   <li>E-Mail invites sent out by Lightning in Outlook 2000/2002/XP compatibility 
    mode, will only be shown by Outlook 2000 if the Service Pack 3 (SP3) has been
    installed.
    (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=377761">bug 377761</a>)</li>
   <li>Adding events or tasks to a CalDAV calendar whose display has been turned off, 
    will not re-enable the display of that calendar.
    (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=421986">bug 421986</a>)</li>
   <li>There are interoperability issues with versions of the DAViCal (RSCDS) 
    CalDAV server prior to release 0.9.5. People using earlier releases of 
    DAViCal are advised to stay with Sunbird 0.8 until they can upgrade their 
    DAViCal installation to the current version.
    (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=448453">bug 448453</a>)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="issues-windows">Windows</h3>
  <ul>
   <li>Printing a calendar does not work on the first attempt, but will work 
    on the following attempts.
    (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=351581">bug 351581</a>)</li>
   <li>
    Due to the lack of official timezone updates from Microsoft for the
    following Windows releases
    <ul>
     <li>Windows 98</li>
     <li>Windows 98 SE</li>
     <li>Windows ME</li>
     <li>Windows NT 4.0</li>
     <li>Windows 2000</li>
    </ul>
    you may experience that events will be shown off by an hour.
    <p>There are unofficial patches available for
     <a href="http://www.intelliadmin.com/blog/2007/02/windows-98-me-dst-patch.html">Windows
     98/98 SE/ME</a> and for
     <a href="http://www.intelliadmin.com/blog/2007/01/unofficial-windows-2000-daylight.html">Windows
     NT 4.0/2000</a>.<br>
     <strong>Note: These patches are not provided by the Mozilla Calendar
     Project and the developers can not guarantee that these patches will work
     as intended and do not have unintended side-effects.</strong></p>
   </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="troubleshooting"><a>Troubleshooting</a></h2>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Poorly designed or incompatible Add-ons can cause problems with Sunbird,
    including making it crash and slowing down calendar display. If you
    encounter strange problems relating to parts of Sunbird no longer working,
    Sunbird not starting, windows with strange or distorted appearance,
    degraded performance, etc, you may be suffering from Add-on trouble.<br>
    Restart Sunbird in Safe Mode. On Windows, start using the "Safe Mode"
    shortcut created in your Start menu or by running
    <code>sunbird.exe -safe-mode</code>. On Linux, start with
    <code>./sunbird -safe-mode</code> and on Mac OS X, run the following
    command in Terminal:<br>
    <code>/Applications/Sunbird.app/Contents/MacOS/sunbird-bin -safe-mode</code>

    When Sunbird is started in Safe Mode, all Add-ons are disabled. Disable
    the Add-on that is causing trouble and then start normally.
