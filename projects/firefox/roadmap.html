    <h4>Jan 1, 2009</h4>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Firefox is one of the most critical delivery vehicles for Gecko, and 
       eventually XULRunner. Our goal is to continue to build a "best of 
       breed" browser product for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. We have
       ambitious goals for the workload between now and our next major release 
       set. This document is a description of our current thinking on how we 
       intend to get to Firefox 2.
    
    <h2>Feature Content</h2>
    <p>Feature planning and discussion is now done entirely in the Mozilla Wiki.
       See 
       <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox:2.0_Product_Planning">Firefox 
       2 Product Planning</a> for more information.</p>
       
    <h2>Branch Plan</h2>
    <p>Firefox 2 will be based on continued development of the Gecko 1.8 branch 
       created for Firefox 1.5. The goal is that Firefox 1.5 and 2 are 
       compatible from a web developer's point of view. New APIs may be added, but
       existing ones should not be removed. The content of the Firefox 2 release
       is to be mostly user-focused and performed on the 1.8 branch, as significant 
       Gecko changes requiring 12 months of shake-n-bake are ongoing on the 
       trunk. Care must be taken by developers to ensure their work reaches
       both locations, to avoid aviary-branch style inconsistencies.</p>
    
    <h3>Branch Management</h3>
    <p>The branch used for developing Firefox 2 is designed to be low traffic,
       to keep everyone focused on the release goals and to ensure Gecko 
       compatibility and stability. All Gecko changes must be approved by drivers,
       regardless of stage in the product cycle. Significant application work needs 
       to be signed off on by the product group. Remember, most UI changes are 
       "significant"! - if not in code size then in impact. 
    
    <h3>Firefox 3.0</h3>
    <p>Firefox 3.0 will be offer additional user interface enhancements and many
       substantial platform improvements.</p>
       
    <h2>Milestone Plan</h2>
    <p>This is, as always, subject to change.</p>

    <h2>Pre-Release Builds</h2>
    <p>Alpha releases are testing milestones and do not represent what we intend
       to ship as final. They may contain missing features, numerous bugs, etc.
       They are intended for our developer and testing community to work with to
       build upon and provide us with early feedback in the event major changes
       need to happen before the final release.
    
    <p>Beta releases are feature-complete and represent a rough idea of what we'd
       like to ship. These are for a more general early-adopter/testing audience
       that wants to see what the next release of Firefox is going to look like
       so that they can provide us with feedback on the most important issues to
       fix before the final release.
       
    <p>Release Candidates are facsimiles of what we intend to ship under any of
       the above categories or the final release itself. We usually post these a
       few days or weeks ahead of the release in question, to see if there are any
       critical bugs present that must be fixed. If there are none, we ship the
       release candidate as "final". 
    
    <p><strong>Please Note!</strong> Alpha releases are not for general
       consumption and may crash, delete your bookmarks, your profile, your hard 
       disk, etc. They are very little more than a blessed Nightly Build. Preview
       Release builds may also suffer bugs and should be downloaded only by people
       willing to test pre-release software.
    
    <h3>Release Dates</h3>
    <p>Dates shown above are tentative and serve only to give you an idea
       of the relative position of one release from another. They represent our
       current state of thinking as to the release dates at the time this document
       was last updated, and may have changed since then.

    <h2>Localization</h2>
    <p>As with 1.x, all releases moving forward will be available in as many
       languages as can be made ready at the time of release. Localizers and 
       others dependent on release timing should use <strong>this document</strong>
       as an indicator of the up-to-date release time. 

    <h2>Marketing</h2>
    <p>Marketing remains an important part of our strategy. The focus of our 
       community marketing initiatives can be found at 
       <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/">SpreadFirefox</a>. In addition
       to this we will continue to develop our own 
       <a href="../../products/firefox/index.html">marketing materials</a>.
