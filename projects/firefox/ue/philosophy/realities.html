    <strong><em><a href="mailto:ben@mozilla.org">Ben Goodger</a>, 11/26/2003</em></strong>

    <p>Firefox is a browser project built on some theories about
       UI design which its developers hold. This document is a catalog
       of some of those, presented in a way that talks about how our 
       target audience interact with software.

    <h2>Users Don't Set Options</h2>
    <p>While many people do change settings in the software they use, 
       by and large people expect the software that they download or
       buy to work pretty much immediately after they install it. They
       do not expect to have to make any configuration changes in order
       for it to function for them efficiently, they will only make
       configuration changes when the need arises (that is, when they 
       wish to optimize their browser for a non-standard scenario, 
       particular to their usage patterns.)
    <p>As a result of this, all options should be configured by default
       for the mass market case. Any function that relies on an option
       to be configured a specific way before it can be useful cannot 
       be considered a mass-market function because odds are that the 
       majority will never configure it. 

    <h2>Who Are We Targeting?</h2>
    <p>We are obviously targeting people who are sophisticated enough
       to be able to download and install new browser software, and people
       who want a more efficient browsing experience than that provided
       by Internet Explorer. We are not explicitly targeting web developers, 
       Mozilla developers, or Mozilla users, we are targeting all browser
       users. Our extension mechanism is such that any hard core geek
       should be able to achieve what they want with our product. 

    <p>By default, our browser should cater to the person who has a busy 
       life and just wants his or her software to work properly with 
       as little interference as possible. In much the same way as you're
       not constantly in Microsoft Word's Options dialog box tweaking 
       Auto-Save details - you just expect Word to do the right thing so
       you can focus on writing your document - Firefox should behave
       properly, quietly, efficiently, seamlessly displaying web content
       and assisting users accomplish common tasks quickly. Our users
       have other things going on in their lives, they do not care about
       the esoteric details of software construction. They want software
       that works now, makes them more productive, and keeps them secure. 
       That is the only real reason to abandon the status quo (IE). Our
       users do not want to invest huge amounts of time learning new 
       commands, new and complicated UI, etc. 
    
    <p>Work in progress...
