    <h2>Status: PROVISIONAL (awaiting modification after review)</h2>
    
    <h2>Problems</h2>
    <div class="category">
      <p>Some problems with the current download manager/progress dialog:
      <ol>
        <li>Individual progress windows clutter workspace.
        <li>Individual progress windows pop-up over browser, annoying. Default 
            behaviour
            is to stick around after download is complete.  (CONFIDENCE IN HANDLER)
        <li>User is asked where to place files every time by default, even if 
            they always download things to the same place. 
        <li>User is asked how files should be handled even for types where there's
            a sensible default action, such as opening MSWord Documents in
            Microsoft Word. This querying is typically done by a jarringly 
            complex Unknown Content Type dialog (<a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a>
            presents a stab at a simplification of the concept) that interferes
            with users' thought processes. 
        <li>Defining and customizing automatic handlers for particular content 
            types is tricky in the Mozilla UI, not present at all in Firefox.
        <li>List of files downloaded is kept until manually cleared, a privacy 
            concern for some.
        <li>Download manager in the sidebar does not fit with the model of the 
            sidebar as a transient source for navigation or information. Keeping
            the panel open robs space from the browser window. At present, people
            seem to prefer progress dialogs to it, and it is not shown by default
            when a download is initiated. As a result, users may not even be 
            aware that it is present, silently keeping track of everything they
            download (see privacy concern above). Since it is not shown by default, 
            it may as well not be there, for the majority of users. 
      </ol>
      </p>
    </div>    

    <h2>Solutions</h2>
    <div class="category">
      <p>Generally, solutions to these problems should involve understanding that:
      <ol>
        <li>Popup windows are annoying, so do for browser chrome what popup 
            blocking has done for web content.
        <li>Remants of downloads (windows that stick around) are annoying to 
            many, and clean up after ourselves when downloading is done by 
            closing the download UI.
        <li>It is best to identify common download scenarios (downloading of 
            common types, such as .doc, .zip etc) and seek ways to streamline
            downloading and opening those files with fewer prompts and clicks.
      </ol>
    
      <p>Thus the goal of this document is to specify User Interface enhancements that
         solve the problems whilst addressing the concerns above, along with:

      <ol>
        <li>Making the UI that is presented when Firefox encounters a file type
            it genuinely doesn't know about simpler, and making the mappings from
            that UI into the creation of automatic content type handlers more
            obvious.
        <li>Making the UI that shows the list of automatic content type handlers
            easier to use, making automatic content type handlers easier to edit.
        <li>Providing a set of options that manage the memory of the download manager, 
            so that aging file data does not sit about.
        <li>Making the download manager UI more consistent with the functionality it
            provides - a utility with a mid-long term presence that should minimize
            its impact on browser use during its operation.
      </ol>

          <ol>
            <li>The action that occurs now is dependent on the download destination 
                preferences specified in Download Options (<a href="#figure3">Figure 3</a>). 
                If the user is using a download folder (they are, by default - Desktop), 
                the file is downloaded to that location.<br><br>
                If the user has selected to be asked every time (<a href="#figure3">Figure 3</a>),
                they are prompted for a save location.

              <li>Download Manager display preferences (per <a href="#figure3">Figure 3</a>
                  are observed for such downloads.
              <li>"Save Link As..." is renamed to "Download Link to Disk" to more correctly
                  reflect the automation afforded by the download system defaults (autodownload
                  to default folder, most often "Desktop"). "Link" handling is separated from
                  handling of "Image"/"Page" above because files downloaded via "Save Link As..." 
                  are usually of more temporally limited interest (install packets, zip files, 
                  documents to be filed) than media (as in the "Image"/"Page" case) which 
                  tend to be filed into more permanent locations. Files downloaded via "Save Link
                  to Disk..." also tend to be those that require some sort of immediate attention
                  precisely because they are not displayed inline as Images/Pages are, so the 
                  default download to Desktop/Download Folder model works well to encourage action
                  to review, file, install or delete the downloaded files.

          <b>User Clicks on a Link to a file of a type that Firefox cannot 
             handle internally. </b>
          <ol>
            <li>Check (internally) for an existing handler for this file type.
                An existing handler is one of:
                <ol type="a">
                  <li>handle file by using the system default handler 
                      for this type, e.g. MSWord for .doc
                  <li>handle file by using a custom handler specified 
                      by the user on a previous occasion
                  <li>download the file to disk
                </ol>
            <li>If no existing handler is present, show the Unknown Content Type
                dialog (<a href="#figure 1">Figure 1</a>) which makes the user
                select how to handle the file. Default state of the "Do this 
                automatically" checkbox is "off" - the dialog box will be shown 
                for each download of files of this type.
            <li>The action that occurs now is a combination of feedback from (1) 
                and (2) and the download destination preferences specified in
                Download Options (<a href="#figure3">Figure 3</a>). If the user
                is using a download folder (they are, by default - Desktop), 
                the file is downloaded to that location and depending on the results
                of (1) and (2) the file is either opened with a handler or left alone
                (Save to Disk) case. <br><br>
                If the user has selected to be asked every time (<a href="#figure3">Figure 3</a>),
                for the Save to Disk case they are prompted for a save location, 
                otherwise the file is downloaded to a temporary location and viewed
                with the applicable handler.

        <h3>Concerns</h3>

        <div class="category">
          <p>The following represent some concerns with Download Manager based
             downloading. All responses are based on the implementation 
             specified here, not on actual present implementations.
          <p>
            <b>"The Download Window popping up is annoying"</b><br>
            Individual Progress Windows popping up are also annoying. In fact, 
            Download Manager improves the popup situation in two ways - if
            a Download Manager window is already open, it will not be focused
            when a new download begins, and you can optionally disable the 
            Download Manager from showing at all.
          <p>
            <b>"The Download Window doesn't go away when it's done"</b><br>
            Neither do Individual Progress Windows, by default. Download Manager
            as specified here closes when current downloads are completed. This
            behaviour is controllable via preference.
          <p>
            <b>"The Download Manager Keeps Track of What I Download"</b><br>
            Just because you've been using Individual Progress Windows does not
            mean that the Download Manager wasn't silently tracking what you've
            been downloading anyway. The Download Manager as specified here
            introduces privacy controls to manage what information is kept. 
          <p>
            <b>"Individual Progress Windows show me the status of each
                individual download in the status bar"</b><br>
            Fair point, however with the advent WindowsXP most users may find
            their task bar buttons being grouped such that the status of each
            download isn't always immediately obvious. The Download Manager 
            specified here takes up less space in the task bar (making grouping 
            less likely to occur) and presents an average of completion metrics 
            for all current downloads which can be useful in the average case 
            (1-2 downloads at a time).

	<div class="category"><h3>Assorted Notes</h3>
	   
		<p>Dan raises good point - consider this scenario. Click link to foo.doc
		   file. Current world - file saved to Local Settings\temp\~fosdff.doc.
		   When you Ctrl+S to save it, you're saving to a wacky name in a wacky
		   location. Instead, when you're using the default download location, 
		   download to temp, then when done, move to the default download location
		   (Desktop\foo.doc) and then open that file. When you hit Ctrl+S, you
		   have a meaningful file name in a meaningful location.

		<p>Dan also points out that it's not always obvious how to change MIME
		   info stored. Some sort of way of invoking the "Change Action..." dialog
		   from the dl mgr ("Change the way files of this type are handled..." 
		   (verbose attempt). Some other hook to lead to the pref panel. Too
		   often settings made through these transient dialogs are not linked
		   in user's mind to how to undo these changes in preferences. 

		<p>Arguments regarding Save Image As... vs. Save Link As... could use
		   refinement. A little weak currently. 

		<p>Finally, perhaps a "Remove All" button in the preferences panel with
		   explanatory text/confirmation, "This will reset download settings
		   to default settings" or some such. Not sure. Maybe Ctrl+A,Remove is
		   enough?
