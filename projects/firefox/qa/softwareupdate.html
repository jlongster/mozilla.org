    <p><strong>This is for people who intend to help us test the Firefox 1.0
       RC2 releases only.</strong> It will tell you how to test
       the in-place update functionality when upgrading from various 
       versions of Firefox.

    <h3>Firefox Preview Release Users</h3>
    <p>If you're using Firefox Preview Release and wish to update to Firefox
       1.0RC2, do the following:

    <ol>
      <li>Open a Firefox window and type <code>about:config</code> in the
          <strong>Location Bar</strong> and hit Enter. 
      <li>In the panel that appears, type <code>app.update.url</code> in the
          <strong>Filter</strong> box. 
      <li>Double click on the row that appears.
      <li>A dialog box will appear. Change the value in the text box to read
          <code>https://aus.mozilla.org/update/firefox/en-US-1.0-rc.rdf</code>
          and click OK.
      <li>Go to <strong>Tools, Options</strong> and choose the 
          <strong>Advanced</strong> panel. Scroll down until you see the 
          <strong>Software Update</strong> section, then click <strong>Check
          Now</strong>
      <li>The <strong>Update Wizard</strong> will appear and check for updates.
          When the check is complete the available updates will be presented.
          Choose the "Firefox 1.0 RC2" option and click <strong>Next</strong>
      <li>Allow the software to download and install and then restart the
          browser. You should now be using Firefox 1.0 RC2.
    </ol>

    <h3>Firefox 1.0RC1&amp;2 Users</h3>
    <p>If you're using Firefox 1.0RC1/2 release and wish to update to Firefox
       1.0 Final (when it comes out), do the following:

    <ol>
      <li>Open a Firefox window and type <kbd>about:config</kbd> 
          in the <strong>Location Bar</strong> and hit Enter. 
      <li>In the panel that appears, type <code>app.update.url</code> in the
          <strong>Filter</strong> box. 
      <li>Double click on the row that appears.
      <li>A dialog box will appear. Change the value in the text box to read
          <kbd>https://aus.mozilla.org/update/firefox/en-US-1.0-rc.rdf</kbd>
          and click OK.
      <li>Type <kbd>app.version</kbd> in the <strong>Filter</strong> box
          replacing the text that is there.

      <li>A dialog box will appear. Change the value in the text box from 
          "1.0" to "0.10" and click OK. This fools the update system into 
          thinking you're using an earlier version of Firefox.

          <strong>Advanced</strong> panel. Scroll down until you see the 
          <strong>Software Update</strong> section, then click <strong>Check

          <strong>Next</strong>
      <li>Allow the software to download and install and then restart the
          browser. You should now be using Firefox 1.0RC2/Final.
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Do not quit the browser once the install phase of the upgrade
       is in progress!</strong>

    <p>If you encounter any problems during the upgrade you can recover by
       downloading a full installer from the website and installing over
       the browser. Please report any problems you find in bugzilla (Firefox
       product, Software Update component).
