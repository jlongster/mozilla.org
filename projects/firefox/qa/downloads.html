    <h2>Core Functionality</h2>

    <p><strong>Downloading Files</strong>- <br>
       1. Click a link in the browser to download a file<br>
       2. Right click a link and choose "Save Target As"<br>
     3. Drag a link onto the Download Manager window<br>

    <p>The file should be downloaded. Depending on the state of 
       options (see below) the Download Manager may appear. If
       the download occurs in less than 2 seconds (e.g. if the
       document has been cached on disk) the Download Manager should
       not appear, regardless of options. This is to streamline
       operations like "Save Image As...". When complete, on 
       Windows an alert should appear at the bottom right of the
       screen. 

    <h2>Options</h2>
    <p><strong>"Show Download Manager when a download begins"</strong>
       - Controls whether or not the download manager appears at
     the start of a download.
    <p><strong>"Close the Download Manager when downloads complete"</strong>
       - When all downloads are complete, the download manager window
       should be closed (like the old progress dialogs). 
    <p><strong>Clear the Download List When</strong> - 
       - Download Successfully Completed, Firefox Exits, or Manually. 
       In the first case download entries are removed from the list when
       the download completes successfully... but not when they are 
       canceled or fail. In the second scenario the list is purged when
       the browser is shut down. In the final scenario the list is never
       purged unless the user does so. 

    <h2>Management</h2>
    <p><strong>Manager Window</strong> - shows a list of downloads, active
       and inactive. New downloads should fade in as they begin transferring. 
    <p><strong>Pause/Resume</strong> - active downloads can be paused/resumed
       within the current session. (download item link, context menu, 
       space bar)
    <p><strong>Cancel</strong> - active downloads can be canceled
        (download item link, context menu)
    <p><strong>Retry</strong> - failed downloads can be re-downloaded
        (double clicking, context menu)
    <p><strong>Remove</strong> - failed and completed downloads can be
       removed from the list (delete key, context menu)
    <p><strong>Show</strong> - completed downloads can be revealed in the
       native file system shell (download item link, context menu)
    <p><strong>Open</strong> - completed downloads can be opened in the
       native environment (by double clicking, context menu)
    <p><strong>Clean Up</strong> - the "Clean Up" button (Alt+N) removes
       all completed, canceled and failed downloads from the list. The 
       Clean Up command and its associated button should only be enabled
       if there are non-active downloads present. 
  
    <p><strong>Error Checking</strong> - the download list should not become
       corrupted or contain bad entries. Error checking is performed on the
       list before the downloads datasource is flushed to disk. 
  
    <p><strong>Options</strong> - the Options button should show the
       Download Options panel in the Options window. This setting does not
       cause the "panel memory" of the main preferences panel to shift to
       that of the Downloads panel.

    <h2>Progress</h2>
    <p><strong>Progress Bar</strong> - each active download item has a
       progress bar that shows the current percentage complete. 
    <p><strong>Progress Text</strong> - each active download item has
       a text area below the progress bar that shows the portion of the
       file that has downloaded, and the total amount to download. Amounts
       less than 1MB are presented in KB, amounts greater than 1MB are
       shown in MB. The transfer rate is also shown, if the download is
       not paused. 
    <p><strong>Title Bar</strong> - an average complete percentage is shown
       in the download manager title bar along with the number of active
       downloads. This is modified as new downloads are added and active
       downloads complete. 
    <p><strong>Completion Notification</strong> - when all downloads are
       complete a mail-biff style notification appears in the bottom right
       of the screen (Windows). The link in the notification is clickable
       if the completed downloads are still present in the download manager
       list, that is, if the retention policy is not set to "Remove upon
       successful download".

    <h2>Other Functionality</h2>
    <p><strong>Exiting</strong> - when the application is quit either by
       File->Exit or by the user closing all windows, if there are active
       downloads the user should be warned with a dialog (parented to the
       download manager, if it is open, to some other window if it is not)
       that shows the number of downloads that will be canceled. If the user
       chooses to cancel the quit, the quit command is aborted and the 
       application remains open so the downloads can complete.
