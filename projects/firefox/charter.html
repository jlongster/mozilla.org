    <p><em><a href="mailto:ben@mozilla.org">Ben Goodger</a> (11/28/2004)</em></p>

    <p>Today, the goal of the Firefox project is to deliver the best possible
       browsing experience to the widest possible set of people. We aim to do
       this in part by:

    <ul>
      <li>Delivering the <em>right set of features</em> - not too many 
          or too few (the goal is to create a useful browser, not a
          minimal browser)
      <li>Making as few compromises as possible where user experience is
          concerned. We will not compromise the main line UI to placate
          an element of the community. Usability is a large area consisting
          not only of the things one typically considers related to the 
          user experience such as the design of dialog boxes and windows,
          but also things such as interaction design (looking at how 
          users try and accomplish a task, noting the paths they take and
          attempting to optimize those paths) and performance (reaction
          speed from a piece of software is important so as not to annoy
          the user - perceived speed is often more important than actual
          speed). 
      <li>Develop and maintain an extension system to allow for research
          into new areas without affecting the core and to allow for 
          techies, early adopters, web developers and other specific 
          communities to customize their browsers to suit their specific
          needs without affecting usability or download size for the
          mass market. 
      <li>Retaining a tight command and control hierarchy. UI design is
          not a committee driven process. Application design must be 
          nimble and testing is better than discussion, so:
      <li>Make changes quickly and then get them to people so that we
          can refine them based on observation of user interactions.
      <li>Deliver software for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux, with the goal
          of integrating as slickly as possible into each of those 
          systems.
      <li>Be, if possible, a vehicle for emerging Mozilla platform APIs
          including XULRunner, which will allow application developers
          a means to deploy useful software to people that is not 
          necessarily tied to a particular operating system.
      <li>Keeping the download size down - to less than 5.0MB on Windows
          for the installer. 
    </ul>
