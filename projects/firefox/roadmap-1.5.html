    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Firefox will be one of the most critical delivery vehicles for Gecko and
       XULRunner technology in 2005. Our goal is to continue to build a 
       "best of breed" browser product for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. We have
       ambitious goals for the workload between now and our next major release 
       set. This document is a description of our current thinking on how we 
       intend to get to Firefox 2.0. At this stage it is brief, but over time
       it will grow much as the <a href="roadmap-1.0.html">1.0 roadmap</a>
       did.

    <h2>Structure</h2>
    <p>We are planning for a Firefox 2.0 and 3.0, but will divide the planned work
       over (at this point) three major Milestones, 1.5 (September 2005), 2.0
       (unscheduled) and 3.0 (unscheduled). All major development work will be 
       done on the Mozilla trunk, and these releases will coincide with Gecko 
       version revs.

    <h2>Milestone Plan</h2>
    <p>This is, as always, subject to change.</p>

    <p>Dates are, as always, subject to change and represent our collective view of
       the state of the set of work remaining to be done at the time this document
       is updated.</p>
    <p>... visually, the 1.5 plan looks something like this:</p>
    <p><img src="../../roadmap/branching-2005-05-04.png"></p>
    <p>(note that the dates in this diagram are incorrect)</p>
    
    <h3>On Naming...</h3>
    <p>After some discourse, we have settled on the following naming structure
       for our releases going forward:
       
       <ol>
        <li>Each major release has a code name (e.g. 1.5 is <em>"Deer Park"</em>)
            </li>
        <li>The alpha releases are named 
            <em>&ldquo;&lt;codename&gt; alpha&rdquo;</em></li>
        <li>The public beta release is named <em>Firefox 1.5 beta</em></li>
        <li>The final release is named <em>&ldquo;Firefox &lt;version&gt;&rdquo;</em></li>
       </ol>
     
    <p>Alpha releases are testing milestones and do not represent what we intend
       to ship as final. They may contain missing features, numerous bugs, etc.
       They are intended for our developer and testing community to work with to
       build upon and provide us with early feedback in the event major changes
       need to happen before the final release.
    
    <p>Beta releases are feature-complete and represent a rough idea of what we'd
       like to ship. These are for a more general early-adopter/testing audience
       that wants to see what the next release of Firefox is going to look like
       so that they can provide us with feedback on the most important issues to
       fix before the final release.
       
    <p>Release Candidates are facsimiles of what we intend to ship under any of
       the above categories or the final release itself. We usually post these a
       few days or weeks ahead of the release in question, to see if there are any
       critical bugs present that must be fixed. If there are none, we ship the
       release candidate as "final". 
    
    <p><strong>Please Note!</strong> Alpha releases are not for general
       consumption and may crash, delete your bookmarks, your profile, your hard 
       disk, etc. They are very little more than a blessed Nightly Build. Preview
       Release builds may also suffer bugs and should be downloaded only by people
       willing to test pre-release software.
    
    <h3>On Release Dates...</h3>
    <p>Dates shown above are tentative and serve only to give you an idea
       of the relative position of one release from another. They represent our
       current state of thinking as to the release dates at the time this document
       was last updated, and may have changed since then.

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>We are still working on goals for 2.0/3.0 and are drafting a PRD for its
       development. Some likely goals include: 

       <ul>
         <li>Improvements to Bookmarks/History
         <li>Per-Site Options
         <li>Enhancements to the Extensions system, Find Toolbar, Software 
             Update, Search and other areas.
         <li>Accessibility compliance
         <li>More ... ?
       </ul>

    <p>(Note: placing an item on this list does not mean it will not be 
        complete <em>until</em> 2.0/3.0, rather we would like to be done by
        2.0/3.0, it may be implemented by 1.5, 2.0 or 3.0)

    <h2>Localization</h2>
    <p>As with 1.0, all releases moving forward will be available in as many
       languages as can be made ready at the time of release. Localizers and 
       others dependent on release timing should use <strong>this document</strong>
       as an indicator of the up-to-date release time. 

    <h2>Marketing</h2>
    <p>Marketing remains an important part of our strategy. The focus of our 
       community marketing initiatives can be found at 
       <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/">SpreadFirefox</a>. In addition
       to this we will continue to develop our own 
       <a href="../../products/firefox/index.html">marketing materials</a>.

    <h2>Branding (tentative)</h2>
    <p>Firefox 1.5 etc will be referred to as "Mozilla Firefox". Firefox 2.0 
       will be called "Mozilla Firefox 2". Detailed version information will be 
       displayed in the About box.

    <h2>Support Network</h2>
    <p>Firefox has a tremendous community following, and we wish to highlight 
       the following two sites - <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/support/firefox/">Firefox 
       Help</a> for a huge amount of helpful Firefox-related information; 
       and <a href="http://forums.mozillazine.org/index.php?c=4">
       MozillaZine Forums</a> - our premier discussion site for 
       users and developers.</p>
