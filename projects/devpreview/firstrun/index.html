  <p><em>Congratulations!</em> You are running the Mozilla
    Developer Preview, an alpha release for early testing of future Firefox features. Mozilla needs your help
    to test new features and find problems with our products.
    Helping out won't take much of your time, doesn't
    require special skills, and will help make the next version of
    Firefox even better.

<h2>How You Can Help</h2>

<dl class="tasklist">
<dt>Test Your Plugins</dt>
<dd>If you have plugins installed, please test pages which use plugin features.
  For more details, see the
  <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Plugins/OOPP_Testing">out-of-process plugin testing page</a>.

<dt>Test Secure Websites
<dd>Please test any secure websites you use, such as bank websites. We are
  especially interested in problems that may occur with client certificates or
  other unusual SSL configurations.

<dt>Submit crash reports</dt>
<dd>Please submit crash reports when prompted by the Crash Reporter. The Crash
	Reporter reports give us valuable data on which crashes are the most
	common and serious. A comment detailing what you
        were doing at the time of the crash is especially helpful.</dd>

<dt>Join the QA Team</dt>
<dd>Mozilla QA has a page dedicated to ways to get involved with helping. You
	don't have to be technical and being involved is good for people wanting to
	get more familiar with Mozilla and Firefox to contribute to the project.
	<a href="http://quality.mozilla.org">Get Involved!</a></dd>

<div id="side" class="right">
<p style="margin-top: 1em"><strong>Note:</strong> The Mozilla Developer Preview build you are using is
	<strong>NOT A FINAL VERSION</strong> of Firefox, it has been made available
	for testing purposes only, with no end-user support. If that sounds scary,
	you'd probably be better off with the latest version of Firefox that you can
	<a href="http://www.firefox.com/">download here</a>.</p>
