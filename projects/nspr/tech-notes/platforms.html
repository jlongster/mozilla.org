<h1>
NSPR: Build System and Supported Platforms</h1>

<blockquote><b>Note:</b> This was written in 1998. Platforms and releases
have changed since then. See the release notes for current data.</blockquote>

<p><br>NSPR has been implemented on over 20 platforms. A platform may have
more than one implementation strategy of its multi threading and I/O facilities.
This article explains the NSPR build system and how to specify a particular
implementation strategy, compiler or compiler switches, or the target OS
for your build on each platform.
<h2>
Implementation Strategies</h2>
Threads are at the core of NSPR, and the I/O functions are tied to the
multi threading facilities because many I/O functions may block the calling
threads. NSPR has multiple implementation strategies of its multi threading
and I/O functions. The various implementation strategies can be organized
into the hierarchy below:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Classic NSPR </b>(This is our first code base, hence the term "classic
NSPR"):</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Local threads only</b>: All threads are user-level threads implemented
by NSPR.</li>

<li>
<b>Global threads only</b>: All threads are native threads supplied by
the OS vendor. For example, Solaris UI (Unix International) threads and
Win32 threads.</li>

<li>
<b>Combined</b>: NSPR multiplexes user-level threads on top of native,
kernel-level threads. This is also called the MxN model. At present, there
are three implementations of the combined model.</li>

<ul>
<li>
IRIX: sprocs + NSPR user-level threads</li>

<li>
Windows NT: Win32 threads + NT fibers</li>

<li>
<b>Pthreads-user</b>: kernel-level pthreads + NSPR user-level threads</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Pthreads</b>: All threads are pthreads. The relevant code is in <tt>mozilla/nsprpub/pr/src/pthreads</tt>
(threads and I/O).</li>
</ul>
Classic NSPR and pthreads have relatively disjoint code bases in the threads
and I/O areas:
<ul>
<li>
Classic NSPR: <tt>mozilla/nsprpub/pr/src/threads/combined</tt> (threads),
<tt>mozilla/nsprpub/pr/src/io</tt> (I/O)</li>

<li>
Pthreads: <tt>mozilla/nsprpub/pr/src/pthreads</tt> (threads and I/O)</li>
</ul>
Note that some files under <tt>mozilla/nsprpub/pr/src/io</tt> are shared
by both classic NSPR and pthreads. Consult <tt>mozilla/nsprpub/pr/src/Makefile</tt>
for the definitive list of files used by each implementation strategy (see
the definition of the makefile variable <tt>OBJS</tt>).
<h2>
Compilers</h2>
For ease of integration with third-party libraries, which may use native
threads, NSPR uses the native threads whenever possible. As a result, native
compilers are used to build NSPR on most platforms because they have better
debugging support for native threads. The only exception is Solaris, where
both cc and gcc are used.
<h2>
NSPR Build System</h2>
On Unix and Win32, NSPR build system is based on GNU make. (GNU make can
be obtained by anonymous ftp from <tt><a href="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/">ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/</a></tt>.)
On Mac, NSPR uses Metrowork's CodeWarrior Mac project files.
<p>Inside Netscape, we use GNU make 3.74 on Unix, but our makefiles should
work fine under newer versions of GNU make. On Win32, we use an internal
Win32 port of GNU make 3.74 and a homegrown stripped-down version of Bourne
shell called <tt>shmsdos.exe</tt>. Our own Win32 port of GNU make and <tt>shmsdos.exe</tt>
are distributed with the NSPR source. Our makefiles also work under the
official Win32 port of GNU make (3.75 and above) and the Korn shell <tt>sh.exe</tt>
in MKS Toolkit.
<p>Every directory in NSPR has a makefile named <tt>Makefile</tt>, which
includes the makefile fragments in <tt>mozilla/nsprpub/config</tt>. NSPR
makefiles implement the common Netscape makefile targets such as <tt>export</tt>,
<tt>libs</tt>,
and <tt>install</tt>. However, some makefiles targets are no-op in NSPR
because they are not necessary for NSPR.
<p>To build NSPR, change directory to the root of our source tree
<br><tt>cd mozilla/nsprpub</tt>
<br>and then issue the command
<br><tt>gmake</tt>
<br>Make will recursively go into all the subdirectories and the right
things will happen.
<p>The table below lists the common NSPR makefile targets.

<h2>
Platforms</h2>
Platforms supported by NSPR can be divided into three categories: Unix,
Windows, and Mac. At present, NSPR aims to support Netscape Communicator
5.0 and Server Suitespot 4.0. The platforms on which we build our binary
releases are listed below.
<h3>
Unix</h3>
AIX: 4.2.1
<ul>The default implementation strategy is pthreads. Local threads only
and pthreads-user versions are also available. To build the local threads
only version, use the command
<br><tt>gmake CLASSIC_NSPR=1</tt>
<br>To build the pthreads-user version, use the command
<br><tt>gmake PTHREADS_USER=1</tt></ul>
BSD/386: 3.0, 2.1
<ul>The default implementation strategy is local threads only.</ul>
Digital Unix: V4.0B
<ul>The default implementation strategy is pthreads. To build the local
threads only version, use the command
<br><tt>gmake CLASSIC_NSPR=1</tt></ul>
FreeBSD: 2.2
<ul>The default implementation strategy is local threads only.</ul>
HP-UX: B.10.10
<ul>The default implementation strategy is pthreads, or rather DCE threads
(Posix thread draft 4). To build the local threads only version, use the
command
<br><tt>gmake CLASSIC_NSPR=1</tt></ul>
HP-UX: B.11.00
<ul>The default implementation strategy is pthreads. Local threads only
and pthreads-user versions are also available. To build the local threads
only version, use the command
<br><tt>gmake CLASSIC_NSPR=1</tt>
<br>To build the pthreads-user version, use the command
<br><tt>gmake PTHREADS_USER=1</tt></ul>
Irix: 6.2
<ul>The default implementation strategy is combined (MxN). A global thread
is mapped to an Irix sproc. Local threads are implemented using user-level
context switching in NSPR. The primordial thread, which executes the <tt>main()</tt>
function, is a local thread.
<br>The pthreads version is also available. To build the pthreads version,
use the command
<br><tt>gmake USE_PTHREADS=1</tt></ul>
Linux: 2.0
<ul>The default implementation strategy is local threads only. The pthreads
version, based on LinuxThreads, is mostly working. To build the pthreads
version, use the command
<br><tt>gmake USE_PTHREADS=1</tt></ul>
MkLinux/PPC: 2.0
<ul>The default implementation strategy is local threads only.</ul>
NCR: 3.0
<ul>The default implementation strategy is local threads only.</ul>
NEC: 4.2
<ul>The default implementation strategy is local threads only.</ul>
SCO_SV: 3.2
<ul>The default implementation strategy is local threads only.</ul>
SINIX: 5.42
<ul>The default implementation strategy is local threads only.</ul>
Solaris: 2.5.1 sparc, 2.5.1 x86
<ul>The default implementation strategy is global threads only, in which
every NSPR thread is mapped to a native Solaris UI thread. Local threads
only and pthreads versions are also available. To build the local threads
only version, use the command
<br><tt>gmake LOCAL_THREADS_ONLY=1</tt>
<br>To build the pthreads version, use the command
<br><tt>gmake USE_PTHREADS=1</tt>
<br>To build with gcc and g++, use the command
<br><tt>gmake NS_USE_GCC=1</tt></ul>
SunOS 4: 4.1.3_U1
<ul>The default implementation strategy is local threads only.</ul>
UNIXWARE: 2.1
<ul>The default implementation strategy is local threads only.</ul>

<h3>
Windows</h3>
Windows NT: 3.51, 4.0, Windows 2000
<ul>The default implementation strategy is combined (MxN). A global thread
is mapped to a Win32 native thread. A local thread is an NT fiber. The
primordial thread, which executes main(), is a local thread.
<p>NSPR requires NT 3.51 Service Pack 5 or NT 4.0 Service Pack 3. The service
packs can be downloaded from Microsoft's ftp site at <a href="ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/fixes/usa">ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/fixes/usa</a>.</ul>
Windows 95, 98, Me
<ul>The default implementation strategy is global threads only. Note that
the Windows 9x binary is the generic Win32 binary that runs on both Windows
9x and NT.
<br>Windows 9x version of NSPR can be built on an NT machine with the command
<br><tt>gmake OS_TARGET=WIN95</tt></ul>
Windows 3.1 (16-bit Windows)
<ul>The default implementation strategy is local threads only. Windows
3.1 version of NSPR can be built on an NT machine with the command
<br><tt>gmake OS_TARGET=WIN16</tt></ul>

<h3>
Mac</h3>

<ul>The default implementation strategy is local threads only.</ul>
