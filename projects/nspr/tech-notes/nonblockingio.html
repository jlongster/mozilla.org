<h2>
<a NAME="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
Previously, all I/O in NSPR was <i>blocking</i> (or <i>synchronous</i>).
A thread invoking an io function is blocked until the io operation is finished.
The blocking io model encourages the use of multiple threads as a programming
model. A thread is typically created to attend to one of the simultaneous
I/O operations that may potentially block.
<p>In the <i>nonblocking</i> io model, a file descriptor may be marked
as nonblocking. An io function on a nonblocking file descriptor either
succeeds immediately or fails immediately with <tt>PR_WOULD_BLOCK_ERROR</tt>.
A single thread is sufficient to attend to multiple nonblocking file descriptors
simultaneously. Typically, this central thread invokes <tt>PR_Poll()</tt>
on a set of nonblocking file descriptors. (Note: <tt>PR_Poll()</tt> also
works with blocking file descriptors, although it is less useful in the
blocking io model.) When <tt>PR_Poll()</tt> reports that a file descriptor
is ready for some io operation, the central thread invokes that io function
on the file descriptor.
<h2>
<a NAME="Creating a nonblocking socket"></a>Creating a Nonblocking Socket</h2>
<i>Only sockets can be made nonblocking</i>. Regular files always operate
in blocking mode. This is not a serious constraint as one can assume that
disk I/O never blocks. Fundamentally, this constraint is due to the fact
that nonblocking I/O and <tt>select()</tt> are only available to sockets
on some platforms (e.g., Winsock).
<p>In NSPR, a new socket returned by <tt>PR_NewTCPSocket()</tt> or <tt>PR_NewUDPSocket()</tt>
is always created in blocking mode. One can make the new socket nonblocking
by using <tt>PR_SetSockOpt()</tt> as in the example below (error checking
is omitted for clarity):
<br><tt>PRFileDesc *sock;</tt>
<br><b><tt>PRIntn optval = 1;</tt></b>
<p><tt>sock = PR_NewTCPSocket();</tt>
<p><tt>/*</tt>
<br><tt>* Make the socket nonblocking</tt>
<br><tt>*/</tt>
<br><b><tt>PR_SetSockOpt(sock, PR_SockOpt_Nonblocking, &amp;optval, sizeof(optval));</tt></b>
<h2>
<a NAME="Programming constraints"></a><b>Programming Constraints</b></h2>
There are some constraints due to the use of NT asynchronous I/O in the
NSPR. In NSPR, blocking sockets on NT are associated with an I/O completion
port. Once associated with an I/O completion port, we can't disassociate
the socket from the I/O completion port. I have seen some strange problems
with using a nonblocking socket associated with an I/O completion port.
So the first constraint is:
<ul><b>The blocking/nonblocking io mode of a new socket is committed the
first time a <i>potentially-blocking io function</i> is invoked on the
socket. Once the io mode of a socket is committed, it cannot be changed.</b></ul>
The potentially-blocking io functions include <tt>PR_Connect()</tt>, <tt>PR_Accept()</tt>,
<tt>PR_AcceptRead()</tt>,
<tt>PR_Read()</tt>, <tt>PR_Write()</tt>, <tt>PR_Writev()</tt>,
<tt>PR_Recv()</tt>,
<tt>PR_Send()</tt>, <tt>PR_RecvFrom()</tt>, <tt>PR_SendTo()</tt>, and <tt>PR_TransmitFile(),</tt>
and do not include <tt>PR_Bind()</tt> and
<tt>PR_Listen()</tt>.
<p>In blocking mode, any of these potentially-blocking functions requires
the use of the NT I/O completion port. So at that point we must determine
whether to associate the socket with the I/O completion or not, and that
decision cannot be changed later.
<p>There is a second constraint, due to the use of NT asynchronous I/O
and the recycling of used sockets:
<ul><b>The new socket returned by <tt>PR_Accept()</tt> or <tt>PR_AcceptRead()</tt>
inherits the blocking/nonblocking io mode of the listening socket and this
cannot be changed.</b></ul>
The socket returned by <tt>PR_Accept()</tt> or <tt>PR_AcceptRead()</tt>
on a blocking, listening socket may be a recycled socket previously used
in a <tt>PR_TransmitFile()</tt> call. Since <tt>PR_TransmitFile()</tt>
only operates in blocking mode (see Section "<a href="#AcceptRead and TransmitFile blocking mode only">Differences
from Blocking IO</a>" below), this recycled socket can only be reused in
blocking mode, hence the above constraint.
<p>Because these constraints only apply to NT, it is advised that you test
your cross-platform code that uses nonblocking io on NT early in the development
cycle. These constraints are enforced in the debug NSPR library by assertions.
<h2>
<a NAME="Differences from blocking IO"></a>Differences from Blocking IO</h2>

<li>
In nonblocking mode, the timeout argument for the io functions is ignored.</li>

<li>
<a NAME="AcceptRead and TransmitFile blocking mode only"></a><tt>PR_AcceptRead()</tt>
and <tt>PR_TransmitFile()</tt> only work on blocking sockets. They do not
make sense in nonblocking mode.</li>

<li>
<tt>PR_Write()</tt>, <tt>PR_Send()</tt>, <tt>PR_Writev()</tt> in blocking
mode block until the entire buffer is sent. In nonblocking mode, they cannot
block, so they may return with just sending part of the buffer.</li>

<h2>
<a NAME="PR_Poll() or PR_Select()?"></a>PR_Poll() or PR_Select()?</h2>
<tt>PR_Select()</tt> is deprecated, now declared in <tt>private/pprio.h</tt>.
Use <tt>PR_Poll()</tt> instead.
<p>The current implementation of <tt>PR_Select()</tt> simply calls
<tt>PR_Poll()</tt>,
so it is sure to have worse performance. Also, native file descriptors
(socket handles) cannot be added to <tt>PR_fd_set</tt>, i.e., the functions
<tt>PR_FD_NSET</tt>, <tt>PR_FD_NCLR</tt>, <tt>PR_FD_NISSET</tt> do not
work.
<h2>
<a NAME="PR_Available()"></a>PR_Available()</h2>
When <tt>PR_Available()</tt> returns 0, it may mean one of two things:
<li>
There is no data available for reading on that socket. I.e., <tt>PR_Recv()</tt>
would block (a blocking socket) or fail with <tt>PR_WOULD_BLOCK_ERROR</tt>
(a nonblocking socket).</li>

<li>
The TCP connection on that socket has been closed (end of stream).</li>

<p><br>These two cases can be distinguished by <tt>PR_Poll()</tt>. If
<tt>PR_Poll()</tt>
reports that the socket is readable (i.e., <tt>PR_POLL_READ</tt> is set
in <tt>out_flags</tt>), and <tt>PR_Available()</tt> returns 0, this means
that the socket connection is closed.
