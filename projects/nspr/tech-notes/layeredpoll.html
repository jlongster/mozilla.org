NSPR 2.0: <TT>PR_Poll()</TT> and the layered I/O</H2>
<I><FONT SIZE=-2>[last edited by AOF
8 August 1998]</FONT></I>
<P>This memo discusses some of the nuances of using PR_Poll() in conjunction
with <I>layered I/O</I>. This is a relatively new feature in NSPR 2.0,
not that it hasn't been in the source tree for a while, but in that it
has had no clients.
<H3>
History</H3>
The idea was first proposed in the latter half of 1997. The first prototype
implementation was actually done outside the NSPR group. It first made
its way into the NSPR code tree around the first of the year, but was basically
unused. In the March timeframe it was found deficient in a number of areas.
These areas were addressed, requiring a moderate API change (if there is
such a thing) and some significant changes in both the runtime and client
code.
<P>The changes to the runtime were included in the May release of NSPR
(1980529). Unfortunately, the changes were made only in the pthreads implementation.
The task of propagating the required changes to the classic (UNIX, WINDOWS,
MAC, etc) NSPR dropped through the cracks and the omission was not noticed
because the facility still had no clients.
<P>This changed in mid July of this year. We are still discovering new
bugs and in some cases having to educate our clients on the feature's use.
Some of the problem is lack of documentation. This memo will <I>attempt</I>
to correct that shortcoming.
<H3>
Implementation</H3>
NSPR provides a public API function, PR_Poll() that is modeled after UNIX'
<TT>poll()</TT>
system call.
<UL><PRE>
PRInt32 PR_Poll(
    PRPollDesc *pds, PRIntn npds, PRIntervalTime timeout);
</PRE></UL>
The implementation of <TT>PR_Poll()</TT> is somewhat complicated. Not only
does it map the <TT>PRPollDesc</TT> array into structures needed by the
underlying OS, it also must deal with layered I/O. This is done despite
the fact that <TT>PR_Poll()</TT> itself is <I>not</I> layered. For every
element of the <TT>PRPollDesc</TT> array that has a non-NULL <TT>PRFileDesc</TT>
and whose <TT>in_flags</TT> are not zero, it calls the file descriptor's
<TT>poll()
method</TT>.
<P>The <TT>poll()</TT> method is one of the vector contained in the <TT>PRIOMethods</TT>
table. In the case of layered I/O, the elements (the methods) of the methods
table may be overridden by the implementor of that layer. The layers are
then <I>stacked.</I> I/O using that <I>stack</I> will call through the
method at the top layer, and each layer may make altering decisions regarding
how the I/O operation should proceed.
<P>The signature for the <TT>poll()</TT> method is
<BR> 
<UL><PRE>
typedef PRInt16 (*PRPollFN)(
    PRFileDesc *fd, PRInt16 in_flags, PRInt16 *out_flags);
</PRE></UL>
The default implementation for this function is
<UL><PRE>
{ return fd->lower->methods->poll(in_flags, out_flags); }
</PRE></UL>
The purpose of the <TT>poll()</TT> method is to allow a layer to modify
the flags that will ultimately be used in the call to the underlying OS'
<TT>poll()</TT>
(or equivalent) function. Such modification might be useful if one was
implementing an augmented stream protocol (<I>e.g.,</I> <B>SSL</B>). SSL
stands for <B>Secure Socket Layer</B>, hence the obvious applicability
as an example. But it is way to complicated to describe in this memo, so
this memo will use a much simpler layered protocol.
<P>The example protocol is one that, in order to send <I>n</I> bytes, it
must first ask the connection's peer if the peer is willing to receive
that many bytes. The form of the request is 4 bytes (binary) stating the
number of bytes the sender wishes to transmit. The peer will send back
the number of bytes it is willing to receive (in the test code there are
no error conditions, so don't even ask).
<P>The implication of the protocol is obvious. In order to do a <TT>PR_Send()</TT>
operation, the layer must first do a <I>different </I>send and then <I>receive</I>
a response. Doing this and keeping the <I>stack's</I> client unaware is
the goal. <B><I>It is not a goal of NSPR 2.0 to hide the nuances of synchronous
verses non-blocking I/O</I></B><I>.</I>
<H3>
The layered methods</H3>
Each layer must implement a suitable function for <I>every</I> element
of the methods table. One can get a copy of default methods by calling
<TT>PR_GetDefaultIOMethods().</TT> These methods simply pass all calls
through the layer on to the next lower layer of the stack.
<UL><PRE>
const PRIOMethods *PR_GetDefaultIOMethods(void);
</PRE></UL>

A layer implementor might copy the elements of the <TT>PRIOMethods</TT>
acquired from this function into a methods table of its own, then override
just those methods of interest. <I>Usually</I> (with only a single exception)
a layered method will perform its design duties and then call the next
lower layer's equivalent function.
<H4>
Layered <TT>poll()</TT></H4>
One of the more interesting methods is the <TT>poll()</TT>. It is called
by the runtime whenever the client calls <TT>PR_Poll()</TT>. It may be
called at the <I>top</I> layer for <I>every</I> file descriptor in the
poll descriptor. It may be called zero or more times. The purpose of the
<TT>poll()</TT> method is to provide the layer an opportunity to adjust
the polling bits as needed. For instance, if a client (<I>i.e.</I>, top
layer) is calling <TT>PR_Poll()</TT> for a particular file descriptor with
a <I>read</I> poll request, a lower layer might decide that it must perform
a <I>write </I>first.
<P>In that case, the layer's <TT>poll()</TT> method would be called with
<B><TT>in_flags</TT></B> including a <TT>PR_POLL_READ</TT> flag. However,
the <TT>poll()</TT> method would call the next lower layer's <TT>poll()</TT>
method with a <TT>PR_POLL_WRITE</TT> bit set. This process of re-assigning
the poll flags can happen as many times as there are layers in the stack.
It is the final value, the one returned to the caller of the top layer's
<TT>poll()</TT> method  (<TT>PR_Poll()</TT>) that will be used by
the runtime when calling the OS' <TT>poll()</TT> (or equivalent) system
call.
<P>It is expected that the modification of the polling bits propagate from
the top of the stack down, allowing the layer closest to the bottom of
the stack to provide the final setting. The implication is that there should
be no modifications of the <B><TT>in_flags</TT></B> during the <I>return</I>
phase of the layered function.
<P>For example:

<UL><PRE>
PRInt16 LayeredPoll(
    PRFileDesc *fd, PRInt16 in_flags, PRInt16 *out_flags)
{
    PRInt16 final_in_flags;
    PRInt16 new_in_flags = ...;
    ... apply desired logic to assign new_in_flags ...
    final_in_flags = fd->lower->methods->poll(
        fd->lower, new_in_flags, out_flags);
    return final_in_flags;
}
</PRE></UL>

It is not advised to modify the <TT>final_in_flags</TT> between the call
to the lower layer's <TT>poll()</TT> method and the <TT>return</TT> statement.
<P>The third argument of the <TT>poll()</TT> method is a pointer to a 16-bit
word. If the layer sets a value in memory through that pointer <I>and</I>
returns with a value that has <I>corresponding</I> bits, the runtime assumes
that the file descriptor is ready immediately.
<P>There are two important deviations from the normal. First, this is the
one (known) exception to having a layered routine call the stack's next
lower layer method. If bits are set in the <TT>out_flags</TT> the method
should return <I>directly</I>. Second, the runtime will observe that the
layer claims this file descriptor is ready and suppress the call to the
OS' <TT>poll()</TT> system call.
<P>At this time the only known use for this feature is to allow a layer
to indicate it has buffered <I>input</I>. Note that it is not appropriate
for buffered <I>output</I> since in order to write/send output the runtime
must still confirm with the OS that such an operation is permitted.
<P>Since the <TT>poll()</TT> method may be called zero or more times it
must therefore be <I>idempotent</I> or at least <I>functional</I>.
It will need to look at the layer's state, but must not make modifications
to that state that would cause subsequent calls within the same <TT>PR_Poll()</TT>
call to return a different answer. Since the <TT>poll()</TT> method may
not be called at all, so there is not guarantee that any modifications
that would have been performed by the routine will every happen.
