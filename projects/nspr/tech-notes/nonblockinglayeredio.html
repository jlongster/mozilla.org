NSPR 2.0: Non-blocking layered I/O</H2>
<I><FONT SIZE=-2>[last edited by AOF 24 March 1998 14:15]</FONT></I>

<P>I've recently been working on a long standing issue regarding NSPR's
I/O model. For a long time I've believed that the non-blocking I/O prevalent
in classic operating systems (e.g., UNIX) was the major determent for having
an reasonable layered protocols. Now that I have some first hand experience,
albeit just a silly little test program, I am more convinced that ever
of this truth.

<P>This memo is some of what I think must be done in NSPR's I/O subsystem
to make layered, non-blocking protocols workable. It is just a proposal.
There is an API change.
<H3>
Layered I/O</H3>
NSPR 2.0 defines a structure by which one may define I/O layers. Each layer
looks basically like any other in that it still uses a <B><TT>PRFileDesc</TT></B>
as a object identifier, complete with the <B><TT>IOMethods</TT></B> table
of functions. However, each layer may override default behavior of a particular
operation to implement other services. For instance, the experiment at
hand is one that implements a little reliable echo protocol; the client
sends <I>n</I> bytes, and the same bytes get echoed back by the server.
In the non-layered design of this it is straight forward.

<P>The goal of the experiment&nbsp; was to put a layer between the client
and the network, and not have the client know about it. This additional
layer is one that, before sending the client's data, must ask permission
from the peer layer to send that many bytes. It imposes an additional send
and response inside of each client visible send operation. The receive
operations parallel the sends. Before actually receiving real client data,
the layer receives a notification that the other would like to send some
bytes. The layer is responsible for granting permission for that data to
be sent, then actually receiving the data itself, which is delivered to
the client.

<P>The synchronous form of the layer's operation is straight forward. A
call to receive (<B><TT>PR_Recv()</TT></B>) first receives the request
to send, sends (<B><TT>PR_Send()</TT></B>) the grant, then receives the
actual data (<B><TT>PR_Recv()</TT></B>). All the client of the layer sees
is the data coming in. Similar behavior is observed on the sending side.
<H3>
Non-blocking layered I/O</H3>
The non-blocking method is not so simple. Any of the I/O operations potentially
result in an indication that no progress can be made. The intermediate
layers cannot act directly on this information, but must store the state
of the I/O operation until it can be resumed. The method for determining
that a I/O operation can make progress is to call <B><TT>PR_Poll()</TT></B>
and indicating what type of progress is desired, either input or output
(or some others). Therein lies the problem.

<P>The intermediate layer is performing operations that the client is unaware.
So when the client calls send (<B><TT>PR_Send()</TT></B>) and is told that
the operation would block, it is possible that the layer below is actually
doing a receive (<B><TT>PR_Recv()</TT></B>). The problem is that the flag
bits passed to <B><TT>PR_Poll() </TT></B>are only reflective of the client's
knowledge and desires. This is further complicated by the fact that <B><TT>PR_Poll()</TT></B>
is not layered. That is each layer does not have the opportunity to override
the behavior. It operates, not on a single file descriptor (<B><TT>PRFileDesc</TT></B>),
but on an arbitrary collection of file descriptors.

<P>Into the picture comes another I/O method, <B><TT>poll()</TT></B>. Keep
in mind that all I/O methods are those that are part of the I/O methods
table structure (<B><TT>PRIOMethods</TT></B>). These functions are layered,
and layers may and sometimes must override their behavior by offering unique
implementations. The <B><TT>poll()</TT></B> method is used to provide two
modifying aspects to the semantics of <B><TT>PR_Poll()</TT></B>: redefining
the polling bits (i.e., what to poll for) and to indicate that a layer
is already able to make progress in the&nbsp; manner suggested by the polling
bits.

<P>The signature of the <B><TT>poll()</TT></B> method is
<UL>
<PRE>PRInt16 poll(PRFileDesc *fd, PRInt16 in_flags, PRInt16 *out_flags);</PRE>
</UL>
The <B><TT>poll()</TT></B> method is called by <B><TT>PR_Poll()</TT></B>
as the latter is building the structure to provide the operating system
call. The stack's top layer will be called first. Each layer's implementation
is responsible for performing appropriate operations and possibly calling
the next lower layer's <B><TT>poll()</TT></B> method.

<P>What the poll method is returning are the appropriate flags to assign
to the operating system's call. A layer would compute these based on the
values of the argument <B><TT>in_flags</TT></B> and possibly some state
maintained by the layer for the particular file descriptor.

<P>Additionally, if the layer has buffered data that will allow the operation
defined by <B><TT>in_flags</TT></B> to make progress, it will set corresponding
bits in <B><TT>out_flags</TT></B>. For instance, if <B><TT>in_flags</TT></B>
indicates that the client (or higher layer) wishes to test for read ready
and the layer has input data buffered, it would set the read bits in the
<B><TT>out_flags</TT></B>. If that is the case, then it should also suppress
the calling of the next lower layer's <B><TT>poll()</TT></B> method and
return a value equal to that of <B><TT>in_flags</TT></B>.
