<h3>
1.&nbsp;<a NAME="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
The release 3.1 of nspr is now available at /m/dist/nspr20/v3.1. This release
is backward compatible with the v 3.0 release of nspr. Results of Y2K Compliance
testing are documented.
<h3>
2.&nbsp;<a NAME="What's"></a>What's New</h3>
Several new cross-platform and platform-specific features are available
in this release, in addition to bug fixes.
<h4>
2.1 New functions and features</h4>
1. Support for creation of kernel/bound threads
<blockquote>A new value of PRThreadScope, PR_GLOBAL_BOUND_THREAD, can be
used to create a kernel/bound thread on platforms where native support
is available.</blockquote>
2.&nbsp; Faster implementation of atomic operations
<blockquote>The implementation of atomic operations now uses multiple locks,
as opposed to a single global lock, on platforms that don't support native
atomic operations.</blockquote>
3. Enhancement implementation of PLEvent
<blockquote>Multiple event queues can be created on all platforms. Global
data and functions referencing global data (e.g. PL_GetMainEventQueue())
have been removed. Event queues may be created using different notification
methods: platform native methods and monitored (using PRMonitor). See <a href="http://warp/projects/hardcore/prj-nspr20/specs/plevent.html">specs/plevent.html</a>
for specification of all changes.</blockquote>
4. Inheritance of file descriptors
<blockquote>NSPR file descriptors can be inherited by a child process from
a parent process when using PR_CreateProcess. This feature is fully supported
on Unix and NT and partially supported on Win95/98 (sockets cannot be inherited).</blockquote>
5. Localizable error code translation
<blockquote>The NSPR error codes can be translated to text strings with
UTF-8 encoding. NSPR provides translation to US-English text, with support
for adding callback functions for translation to other languages.
<p>The implementation is for a draft/preliminary API and is subject to
change in future releases without affecting backward compatibility.</blockquote>
6.&nbsp; Faster implementation of TransmitFile function on AIX
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new implementation uses
the native send_file function on AIX 4.3.2, for faster performance.
<p>7. Static libraries not supported
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Static libraries are no longer
supported.
<p>8. Year 2000 Certification
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A <a href="http://warp/hardcore/prj-nspr20/nspr31_y2kplan.html">Year
2000 Test Plan</a> was executed successfully on all the supported platforms
and the <a href="http://warp/hardcore/prj-nspr20/nspr31_y2kreport.html">results</a>
documented.
<h4>
2.2 Bug fixes</h4>
Several <a href="http://scopus.mcom.com/bugsplat/buglist.cgi?bug_status=RESOLVED&bug_status=VERIFIED&bug_status=CLOSED&assigned_to=&changedin=&reporter=&product=NSPR&target_fix_version=3.1&escalation_engineer=&qa_assigned_to=&creation_ts=&creation_ts_2=&resolved_ts=&resolved_ts_2=&verified_ts=&verified_ts_2=&moz_reported_by=&moz_assigned_to=&cmdtype=doit&newqueryname=&order=Importance&form_name=query">bugs</a>
are fixed in this release.
<h4>
2.3 Obsolete&nbsp; interface</h4>
The reader-writer lock interface in libnsps is obsolete as it is now implemented
in libnspr.
<h3>
3.&nbsp;<a NAME="New Release naming"></a>Library Name and Versioning</h3>
Starting with this release, the name of the nspr name will contain the
major number of the release; the new name is libnspr3, except for the Win95
version of NSPR. The Win95 library name is shortened to nspr3, to conform
to the MS-DOS 8.3 rule and also to differentiate with the NT build of nspr
library. The minor releases of nspr will contain new features/bug-fixes,
but will be backward compatible with earlier minor releases with the same
major number.
<p>The full release number of nspr library can be determined in several
ways:
<p>1. The nspr library exports a function, libVersionPoint, that can be
called to retrieve the version of the library.&nbsp; The function and data
prototypes are available for other libraries to provide similar version
information.
<br>2. On Win32 systems, the version number is embedded in the resource
descriptor of the DLL and can be viewed using Windows Explorer. On Unix
system, the "what" command of sccs or the "ident" command of rcs can be
used to obtain the version information.
<br>3. The PR_VersionCheck function can be called to check for compatibility;
given a version number the function returns success condition if the version
of the nspr library loaded into the application is compatible.
<h3>
4.&nbsp;<a NAME="Platforms"></a>Platforms</h3>
The set of supported platforms is listed in the following table. For most
platforms, a single release of the nspr library is used to support all
the current releases of the OS.

<p>Important changes to note are:
<p>1. Irix
<blockquote>
<dt>
The pthreads-based (n32) version of nspr is now the default and only version
available. The sproc-based version (o32) is discontinued..</dt>
</blockquote>
2. Solaris
<blockquote>Two binaries are supported for Solaris
<p>1. The Solaris 2.5.1 binary is for applications running on Solaris 2.5.1
and Solaris 2.6.
<br>2. The Solaris 2.6 binary is for applications running on Solaris 2.6
and 2.7.
<p>The two binaries are needed because Sun does not support applications
built on Solaris 2.5.1 but run on Solaris 2.7.
<p>To use purify on Solaris, libpthread should be explicitly specified
in the list of libraries passed to the linker, ahead of other system libraries
such as -lposix4, -lsocket, -ldl, etc.,.</blockquote>
3. Win32
<blockquote>Support for NT 3.51 is no longer available for both the Win
NT and Win95 builds of NSPR.</blockquote>

<h3>
5.&nbsp;<a NAME="Compatibility"></a>Compatibility</h3>
The&nbsp; release v 3.1 of nspr is both source code and binary compatible
with the v3.0 release of nspr.
<p>For the nspr library, binary compatibility does not preclude the addition
of new error codes to the set of <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/nspr/reference/html/prerr.html#26174">nspr
error codes </a>already defined. An application should allow for nspr functions
returning error codes not documented for the particular release with which
it is linked. This helps to retain backward compatibility as new error
codes are added upon discovery of new information about platform-specific
error codes.
<h3>
6.&nbsp;<a NAME="Release"></a>Release Components</h3>
The main components of this release are a set of shared libraries and header
files for each platform. A debug build and a release (optimized) build
of the libraries are made available for each platform.
<h4>
6.1 Platform Directory</h4>
The platform-dependent name of the directory where the components are placed
is of the form
<p>&nbsp; &lt;os-name>&lt;os-version>[_&lt;compiler>][cpu-arch][_&lt;implementation
strategy>]_&lt;DBG/OPT>.OBJ
<p>&nbsp; For example,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SunOS5.5.1_OPT.OBJ (optimized build)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IRIX6.2_n32_PTH_DBG.OBJ (built using
the -n32 compiler option,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
pthreads implementation strategy)
<h4>
6.2 Implementation Strategy</h4>
For the implementation of nspr, different strategies
are used on&nbsp; different platforms. On some platforms the nspr threads
map directly to the native threads on the platform, while on others nspr
supports both threads that are scheduled by nspr and the native threads.
<p>&nbsp;The default implementation strategies in this release are:
<br>&nbsp; - pthreads: all Unix platforms
<br>&nbsp; - classic: Win NT (combined MxN model, with Windows threads
and fibers)
<br>&nbsp; - native threads: Win95
<h4>
6.3 Components</h4>
Under each &lt;platform> directory, there are:
<p>1. include directory, containing the&nbsp; header files
<br>2. lib directory, containing the libraries. Three libraries are built
on all platforms: nspr, plc, plds. Two other
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; libraries are built on server platforms only: ares
and prstrms.&nbsp; Only shared (dynamic link) and purified
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (for a subset of platforms) versions of the libraries
are built.
<p>The nspr library exports the core nspr20 functions.
<p>The plc (Portable Library C) library is a separate library from&nbsp;
the core nspr20.&nbsp; You do
<br>not need to use plc if you just want to use the core nspr20 functions.&nbsp;
The plc library currently
<br>contains thread-safe&nbsp; string functions and command-line option
functions.
<p>The plds (Portable Library Data Structures) library supports data structures
such as arenas, hash tables, and event queues.&nbsp; It is important to
note that services of&nbsp; plds are not thread-safe. To use these services
in a multi-threaded environment, clients have to implement their own thread-safe
access, by acquiring locks/monitors, for example.
<p>For Solaris platforms with UltraSparc processors only, a platform-specific
library, libultrasparc, is also supplied. This library implements optimized
versions of atomic operations by using the features present in the UltraSparc
(V9) processors, but not in the Sparc (V8) processors.&nbsp; This library
is linked into libnspr, with the name libatomic, by use of the auxiliary
filter mechanism of the Solaris linker. To use this library at runtime,
on UltraSparc systems,&nbsp; libultrasparc21.so should be copied into a
file named libatomic.so and the new file should be present in the path
searched by the linker.
<p>3. bin directory, containing a perl script, compile-et.pl, and a Java
bundle, prerr.properties.
<br>4. mdheader.jar, jar file for the header files.
<br>5. mdbinary.jar,&nbsp; jar for the libraries, executable programs,
and scripts.
<h3>
7.&nbsp;<a NAME="Test"></a>Test Data</h3>
All the major functional areas of nspr were tested using the programs in
the nspr test suite. Both functional and stress tests in the pr/tests directory
were successfully run on multi-processor systems for all platforms, except
for Win95/98.
<h4>
7.1 Runtime Error Detection</h4>
A subset of the test programs were run successfully on Solaris and Windows
NT (both Win95 and Win NT versions) with the purify program.
