<p>Netscape Portable Runtime (NSPR) provides a platform-neutral
API for system level and libc like functions. The API is used in the Mozilla
clients and many of Red Hat's, Sun's, and other software offerings.</p>

in general terms, the goals of NSPR and a bit about how it does it. For

<p>The current release of NSPR is 4.8.3. See
<a href="release-notes/">NSPR Release Notes</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Source distributions and pre-built binaries for supported platforms
may be downloaded from <b><a href="https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/nspr/releases">https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/nspr/releases</a>

<p>The <a href="#NSPRMaintainers">NSPR maintainers</a> do not guarantee
the tip of the NSPR source tree to build or run at any instant in time;
the tip of the tree is the development base. If you want to build NSPR
yourself, use a tagged checkout.</p>

<h2><a name="DocumentationTraining">Documentation and Training</a></h2>

<p>NSPR provides several items of documentation. These are the
"<a href="#NSPRReference">NSPR Reference</a>", some 
<a href="#TechNotes">Technical Notes</a>, and other 
<a href="#TrainingMaterials">traing materials</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="NSPRReference">NSPR Reference</a></h3>

<p>The <a href="reference/html/index.html">NSPR Reference</a> describes each
API public macro, structure and function in the NSPR API. It is intended
to be the definitive reference.</p>
<p>At this writing (19-Sep-2000) the NSPR Reference is a combination of
hand written HTML and generated HTML. Some parts of the NSPR Reference
are maintained using FrameMaker and are exported to HTML. ... Don't ask.
... Moving forward, the entire NSPR Reference will be maintained using
FrameMaker and exported to HTML. If you need to make documentation suggestions
and/or corrections, please submit a Bugzilla report.</p>

<h3><a name="TechNotes">Technical Notes</a></h3>

<p>There are several Tech-Notes applicable to NSPR. These Tech-Notes provide
usage information and hints to developers using or maintaining NSPR.</p>

<table border>
<tr>
  <td><a href="tech-notes/platforms.html">Build System and Supported
Platforms</a></td>
  <td>NSPR uses common build technology across all platforms. This paper
describes features of the build system and makefile macros controlling
the build process. A table showing platforms that NSPR is known to run
on with notes useful to maintainers.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><a href="tech-notes/abruptexit.html">Abrupt Exit</a></td>
  <td>NSPR provides no "thread kill" interface. This paper discusses the
reason why NSPR does not provide a thread kill and offers suggestions for
working without this ill-concieved concept.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><a href="tech-notes/autoaddresses.html">Automatic Variables and Threads</a></td>
  <td>Passing the address of an automatic storage class variable (on the
stack) can make for very nasty bugs in a multithreaded environment. This
paper shows you how much trouble you can get into and what you should do
to avoid these pitfalls.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><a href="tech-notes/forking.html">What about fork()</a></td>
  <td>Using fork() can behave strangely from one Unix to another. This paper
describes some of the differences and offers techniques for consistent
behavior across platforms.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><a href="tech-notes/nonblockingio.html">About Non-Blocking I/O</a></td>
  <td>NSPR was originally intended to offer only blocking socket I/O. For
some good reasons, non-blocking I/O was added later. This paper describes
the non-blocking model.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><a href="tech-notes/ntiotimeoutinterrupt.html">NT's handling of I/O
timeouts is ... ummm ... less than optimum.</a></td>
  <td>When an I/O operation times out on Windows NT, the socket becomes "unusable"
and must be closed. This paper describes this phenomena and provides techniques
for dealing with this ... anomaly.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><a href="tech-notes/appl-hints.html">Optimizing your application for
NSPR</a></td>
  <td>Providing a cross-platform API for Windows, Unix, Mac, et.al. is difficult.
Trade-offs have to be made among performance, feasability, feature, and
objects-of-least-astonishment. This paper describes some techniques that
when applied to the design of your application will ensure reasonable results
across all platforms.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><a href="tech-notes/porting-guide.html">Porting to NSPR to new platforms</a></td>
  <td>Porting NSPR to most Unix platforms is not difficult. Porting NSPR
to other environments can be problematic. This Tech-Note provides some
help in making your port.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><a href="tech-notes/poll-method.html">NSPR poll method</a></td>
  <td>NSPR has a poll method for PRFileDesc. The poll method is usually
used by the PR_Poll function behind the scene, but it is also possible
to use the poll method directly. This Tech-Note describes the poll method,
which is not documented in the NSPR Reference.</td>

<h3><a name="TrainingMaterials">Training Materials</a></h3>

<p>NSPR does not provide extensive training. The following topics
offer some guidance, beyond the NSPR Reference and Technical Notes on how
to use the NSPR API.</p>

<h4>NSPR Test Cases as Examples</h4>

<p>The source tree for NSPR contains a set of test cases in the
directory mozilla/nsprpub/pr/tests. Many of the programs in this directory
show good examples of how to use the NSPR API elements together to obtain
a coherent working application program. See also: <a href="#Testing">Testing
NSPR</a>.</p>

<h4>NSPR Overview slides</h4>

<p>There are some Microsoft Powerpoint slides that were used in
an NSPR <a href="training/overview.ppt">overview tutorial</a> in 1999.</p>

<h4>Programming Threads Using NSPR slides</h4>

<p>This set of Microsoft Powerpoint slides provides a good tutorial
on <a href="training/threads.ppt">using condition variables</a> as a thread
synchronization method. Condition variables are easy to misuse, for the
uninitiated, but provide for a flexible and powerful method of thread 
synchronization.</p>

<h4>Book Chapter</h4>

<p>NSPR is featured in Chapter 5 of Syd Logan's book
<a href="http://www.mypearsonstore.com/bookstore/product.asp?isbn=032124642X">
Cross-Platform Development in C++: Building Mac OS X, Linux, and Windows
Applications</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="CheckoutBuild">Checkout and Build</a></h3>

<p>In general, the NSPR team would prefer that you use a binary
release of NSPR, especially if your interest is as a user of the API 
only. If you are a maintainer, or want to contribute to NSPR, then 
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/NSPR_build_instructions">
here is the procedure</a> for checking out and building NSPR.</p>

<h3><a name="Testing">Testing NSPR</a></h3>

<p>NSPR provides a fairly large test suite. 
<a href="eng-process/test.html">Read more about it.</a></p>

<h3><a name="ContributorsGuide">NSPR Contributor's Guide</a></h3>

<p>So, you think you have something to contribute to NSPR? We
sure could use your help. To help you help us, we are providing some 
<a href="eng-process/contributors.html">guidelines</a>
that we believe are important to maintain the goals and stability of NSPR.</p>

<h3><a name="ReleaseEngineering">NSPR Release Engineering Guide</a></h3>

<p><a href="eng-process/release.html">The NSPR Release Engineering Guide</a> 
is primarily for the NSPR maintainers. It describes the steps
required for building, testing and releasing NSPR for Netscape/AOL/iPlanet
circa 2000. Don't go here unless you really, really need to know.</p>

<h2><a name="ContactsContributors">Contacts and Contributors</a></h2>
