<h1>
Testing NSPR</h1>
NSPR provides an extensive set of test cases. Source for these tests are
in the directory <b>mozilla/nsprpub/pr/tests</b>.
<p>After building the test cases, individual tests can be run by changing
directories to <b>...pr/tests/&lt;BuildTarget></b>, where BuildTarget is
the generated name for the build. Look for it; it should be obvious. From
this directory you can run individual tests by name.
<p>Not all tests are designed to run to completion, run without failing,
or other good behavior. Some tests are malicious and are intended to provoke
or demonstrate bugs in underlying operating systems or vendor provided
libraries.
<p>There is a set of tests believed to run consistently across all Netscape/AOL/iPlanet
supported platforms. These tests can be run using the Korn Shell script:
<b>...pr/tests/runtests.ksh</b>. On Windows platforms, this script can
be run using the MKS toolkit. You may have some success with this script
using the Cygwin toolkit. We have not tested it.
