<b><font size=+3>NSPR Contributor's Guide</font></b>
<p><b>Abstract:</b>
<blockquote>NSPR accepts contributions in the form of bugfixes, new features,
libraries, platform ports, documentation, test cases and other items from
many sources. We (the NSPR module owners) sometimes disappoint our contributors
when we must reject their contributions. We reject contributions for a
variety of reasons. Some of these reasons are not obvious to an outside
observer. NSPR wishes to document some guidelines for those who would contribute
to NSPR. These guidelines should help the contributor in crafting his contribution, 
increasing its likelihood for acceptance.</blockquote>

<hr WIDTH="100%"><a NAME="GeneralGuidelines"></a>General Guidelines</h1>
<b><u>Downward Compatibility.</u></b> Because many different applications,
besides the mozilla client, use the NSPR API, the API must remain downward
compatible across even major releases. This means that the behavior of
an existing public API item in NSPR cannot change. Should you need to have
a similar API, with some slightly different behavior or different function
prototype, then suggest a new API with a different name.
<p><b><u>C Language API.</u></b> The NSPR API is a C Language API. Please
do not contribute Java, C++ or other language wrappers.
<p><b><u>Coding Style.</u></b> NSPR does not have a documented coding style
guide. Look at the extant code. Make yours look like that. Some guidelines
concerning naming conventions can be found in <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/nspr/reference/html/printro.html">NSPR
Naming Conventions</a> in the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/nspr/reference/html/index.html">NSPR
Reference</a>. See also: XXX
<p><b><u>Ownership of your contribution.</u></b> When you contribute something
to NSPR, you must have intellectual property rights to that contribution.
This means that you cannot give us something you snatched from somewhere
else;. it must be your own invention, free and clear of encumberment of
anyone or anything else; pay close attention to the rights of your "Day-Job"
employer. If you snatched it from somewhere else, tell us where; show us
where the right to incorporate it into NSPR exists.
<p><b><u>License under MPL or GPL.</u></b> When you contribute material
to NSPR, you agree to allow your contribution to be licensed under the
MPL or GPL.

<a NAME="BugFixes"></a>BugFixes</h1>
Use <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">Bugzilla</a> to track bugs.
Document the bug or use an existing report. Be verbose in describing what
you are doing and why.
<p>Include your changes as diffs in an attachment to the BugZilla report.
<p>Use a coding style consistent with the source file you are changing.

<a NAME="NewFeatures"></a>New Features</h1>
For purposes of this paper, a "new feature" is defined as some API addition
that goes into the core NSPR library, for example: <tt>libnspr4.dll.</tt>
<p>NSPR is mostly complete. New APIs are driven mostly by the OS vendors
as they add new features. Should you decide that there's something that
NSPR does not cover that should be covered, let's talk. Your proposed API
should encapsulate a relatively low level capability as would be found
in a system call or libc.
<p>Your new feature must be implemented on all platforms supported by NSPR.
When you consider a new API for NSPR ask yourself if your proposed feature
can implement it across all platforms supported by NSPR. If several platforms
cannot be made to implement your API, then it is not a good candidate for
inclusion in NSPR.
<p>Before you begin what may be a substantial effort in making a candidate
feature for NSPR, talk to us. We may tell you that you have a good idea;
we may say that it really is not a good candidate for inclusion in NSPR;
we may give you suggestions on what would make it more generalized, hence
a good candidate for inclusion in NSPR.
<p>Use <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org">Bugzilla</a> to track
your work. Be verbose.
<p>NSPR wants you to document your work. If we accept it, we are going
to have to answer questions about it and/or maintain it. These are some
guidelines for new APIs that you may add to NSPR.
<p><b>Header File Descriptions</b>. Provide header file descriptions that
fully document your public typedefs, enums, macros and functions.
<br>See: <a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/nspr/source/nsprpub/pr/include/prshm.h">prshm.h</a>
as an example of how your header file(s) should be documented.
<p><b>Source File Descriptions</b>. Provide descriptive documentation in
your source (*.c) files. Alas, we have no source files documented as we
think they should be.
<p>The following are some general guidelines to use when implementing new
features:
<ul>
<li>
Don't export global variables.</li>

<li>
Your code must be thread safe.</li>

<li>
You must provide test cases that test all APIs you are adding. See: 
<a href="#TestCases">Test
Cases</a>.</li>
</ul>

<hr WIDTH="100%"><a NAME="NewLibraries"></a>New Libraries</h1>
All the guidelines applicable to <a href="#NewFeatures">New Features</a>
applies to new libraries.
<p>For purposes of this paper, a "new library" is defined as a libary under
the <tt>mozilla/nsprpub/lib</tt> directory tree and built as a separate
library. These libraries exist, for the most part, as "legacy" code from
NSPR 1.0. [Note that the current NSPR module owners do not now nor never
have been involved with NSPR 1.0.]. Such is life. That said: There are
some libraries that implement functions intended for use with applications
using NSPR, such as <tt>...nsprpub/lib/libc/plgetopt.*.</tt>
<br> 
<br> 
<p>- generally useful
<br>- platform abstractions
<br>- you agree to sustain, bug fix
<br>- May rely on the NSPR API
<br>- May NOT rely on any other library API
<br> 
<br> 
<h1>

<hr WIDTH="100%"><a NAME="NewPlatformPorts"></a>New Platform Ports</h1>
- all NSPR API items must be implemented.
<br>- platform specific headers in pr/include/md/_platformname.[h!cfg]
<br>- platform specific code in pr/src/md/platform/*.c
<br>- make rules in config/_platform.mk
<br> 
<h1>

<hr WIDTH="100%"><a NAME="Documentation"></a>Documentation</h1>
The files for NSPR's documentation are maintained using a proprietary word
processing system [don't ask]. Document your work as described in <a href="#NewFeatures">New
Features</a>. Use the style of other NSPR documentation. We will see that
your documentation is transcribed into the appropriate word processor and
the derived HTML shows up on mozilla.org.
<br> 
<h1>

<hr WIDTH="100%"><a NAME="TestCases"></a>Test Cases</h1>
You should provide test cases for all new features and new libraries.
<p>Give consideration to providing a test case when fixing a bug if an
existing test case did not catch a bug it should have caught.
<p>The new test cases should be implemented in the style of other NSPR
test cases.
<p>Test cases should prove that the added API items work as advertized.
<p>Test cases should serve as an example of how to use the API items.
<p>Test cases should provoke failure of every API item and report its failure.
