<h1>What Mozilla users should know about the <code>shell:</code> protocol security issue</h1>

<p>On July 7 a security vulnerability affecting browsers for the
Windows operating system was <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=250180">reported to mozilla.org</a> by Keith McCanless, and was subsequently
posted to Full Disclosure, a public security
mailing list. On the same day, the Mozilla security team confirmed the report
of this security issue affecting the Mozilla Application Suite, Firefox, and
Thunderbird and discussed and developed the fix at Bugzilla bug 250180. We have
confirmed that the bug affects only users of Microsoft's Windows operating
system. The issue does not affect Linux or Macintosh users.</p>

<p>On July 8th, the Mozilla team released a configuration change which resolves this
problem by explicitly disabling the use of the <code>shell:</code> external
protocol handler. The fix is available in two forms.  The first is a small
download which will make this configuration adjustment for the user. The second
fix is to install the newest full release of each of these products.
Instructions on administering these changes can be found below.</p>
