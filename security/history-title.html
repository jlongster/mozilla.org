<p>Web pages with extremely long titles (the posted proof of concept used 2.5 million characters)
can cause Mozilla Firefox and the Mozilla Suite to appear to "hang" on startup when reading
the browsing history data.
The browser will eventually
continue normally although this can take up to several minutes on a slower computer. The
unresponsive starts will continue until the item with the long title is removed from the
history file or eventually expires.</p>

<p>We have investigated this issue and can find no basis for claims that variants
of this denial-of-service attack can cause an exploitable crash, and no evidence
for this claim has been offered. There does not appear to be any risk to users
or their computers beyond the temporary unresponsiveness at startup.
</p>

<p> Should the user encounter this problem the slow starts can be fixed
by deleting the item from history.
</p>
