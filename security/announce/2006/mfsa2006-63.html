<h1>Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2006-63</h1>

<p><span class="label">Title:</span>      JavaScript execution in mail via XBL<br>
<span class="label">Impact:</span>     High<br>
<span class="label">Announced:</span>  September 14, 2006<br>
<span class="label">Reporter:</span>   Georgi Guninski<br>
<span class="label">Products:</span>   Thunderbird, SeaMonkey<br><br>
<span class="label">Fixed in:</span>   Thunderbird 1.5.0.7<br>
<span class="label">&nbsp;</span>      SeaMonkey 1.0.5</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Georgi Guninski demonstrated that even with JavaScript disabled in
mail (the default) an attacker can still execute JavaScript when a
mail message is viewed, replied to, or forwarded by putting the script
in a remote XBL file loaded by the message. The executed script could
be used to alter or change the appearance of the message, and can
act as a "mail-tap" to spy on the contents added to a reply or forward.
For example, the attacker could make a provocative offer to
a rival business and then watch the internal debate as it was forwarded
and replied to.</p>

<p>The victim would have to have chosen to "Load Images"--either for the
individual message or as the default setting -- in order for the XBL file
to be loaded and the JavaScript executed.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>The problem can be avoided in the message window by not viewing the
original HTML of mail messages. Use the "Simple HTML" or plain
text options on the "Message Body As" View menu item instead.</p>

<p>Similarly, avoid the problem when composing a reply or forward
by unchecking the "Compose messages in HTML format" option in
Account Settings to use the plain text editor.</p>
