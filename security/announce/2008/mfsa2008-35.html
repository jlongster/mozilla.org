<span class="label">Announced:</span>  July 15, 2008<br>
<span class="label">Reporter:</span>   Billy Rios, Ben Turner, Dan Veditz<br>
<span class="label">Products:</span>   Firefox<br>

</p>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Billy Rios</strong> reported that if Firefox
is not already running, passing it a command-line URI with pipe ("|") symbols
will open multiple tabs. This URI splitting could be used to launch <code>
chrome:</code> URIs from the command-line, a partial bypass of the fix for
<a href="../2005/mfsa2005-53.html">MFSA 2005-53</a> which was intended to
block external applications from loading such URIs (that vulnerability
remains fixed, however).</p>

<p>This vulnerability could also be used by an attacker to pass URIs to
Firefox that would normally be handled by a vector application by appending it
to a URI not handled by the vector application. For example, web browsers
normally handle <code>file:</code> URIs themselves, or block them from web
content altogether, but this flaw enabled attackers to pass them from another
browser into Firefox. In Firefox 2 scripts running from file: URIs can read
data from a user's entire disk, a risk if the attacker could first place a
malicious file in a guessable location on the local disk. Rios demonstrated that
the so-called "Safari Carpet-bombing vulnerability" could be used for this,
as well as another technique that does not rely on that now-fixed Safari
vulnerability.</p>

<p>In Firefox 3 scripts running in local files have limited access to
other files, almost entirely mitigating the <code>file:</code> attack.
However, combined with a vulnerability which allows an attacker to inject
script into a chrome document the above issue could be used to run
arbitrary code on a victim's computer. Such a chrome injection vulnerability
was discovered in Firefox 3 by Mozilla developers <strong>Ben Turner</strong>
and <strong>Dan Veditz</strong>. In the absence of the attack described
by Billy Rios this injection attack would not run with any special privilege
and would be at best a spoofing vulnerability.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>This attack only works if the user is using another internet-connected
application with Firefox not running. Using Firefox, or making sure
it is at least running, prevents this attack.
