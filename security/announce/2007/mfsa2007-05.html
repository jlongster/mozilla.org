<span class="label">Impact:</span>     Moderate<br>
<span class="label">Announced:</span>  February 23, 2007<br>
<span class="label">Reporter:</span>   shutdown, Michal Zalewski<br>
<span class="label">Products:</span>   Firefox, SeaMonkey<br>
<br>
<span class="label">Fixed in:</span>   Firefox 2.0.0.2<br>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><strong>shutdown</strong> reported that if you could convince a user to
open a blocked popup you could perform a cross-site scripting attack against
any site that contains a frame whose source is a data: URL. To accomplish this
the attacker's site would have to frame the target site plus another frame
whose source is the exact same data: url as the victim site, and then
attempt to open a popup with a javascript: url from the data: frame. It is
unclear whether any high-value target sites that match this description
actually exist.</p>

<p>Similarly, <strong>Michal Zalewski</strong> reported that although pages
loaded from the web normally cannot open windows containing local files,
if you could convince a user to open a blocked popup then this restriction
could be bypassed. In order to take advantage of this flaw the attacker
would have to know the full path to a locally-saved file containing
malicious script. He also reported that a flaw in the seeding of the
pseudo-random number generator resulted in downloaded files being
saved to temporary files with a reasonably predictable name. The two combined
could be used to steal information saved on the local disk.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Do not open blocked popups individually, instead either ignore them or decide
to enable popups on a per-site basis.</p>
