<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Security researcher <strong>Dan Kaminsky</strong> reported an
integer overflow in the Theora video library.  A video's dimensions
were being multiplied together and used in particular memory
allocations.  When the video dimensions were sufficiently large, the
multiplication could overflow a 32-bit integer resulting in too small
a memory buffer being allocated for the video.  An attacker could use
a specially crafted video to write data past the bounds of this
buffer, causing a crash and potentially running arbitrary code on a
victim's computer.</p>

<p>Mozilla intern <strong>David Keeler</strong> also independently
reported this issue as well as an additional crash which was
determined to be a denial-of-service.</p>

<p class="note">Video capabilities were added to the Mozilla browser engine
in Firefox 3.5, SeaMonkey 2.0, and Thunderbird 3.0; prior releases of these
products were not affected.</p>

<p class="note">These bugs were fixed upstream in Theora version 1.1
("Thusnelda") but the older version used in Firefox 3.5 needed this
patch.</p>
