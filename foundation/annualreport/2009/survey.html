<p>Recently we posted our annual "<a href="index.html">State of Mozilla</a>" which describes what we have been working on and plans for the immediate 
future. I want to make sure that the plans laid out in the State of Mozilla reflect and inspire the people who identify themselves with Mozilla and our 
mission. I am asking that you help me make sure of this.</p>

<p>We’ve put together a <a href="https://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/422662/f28c39e89eac">short survey</a>. I hope you will take 15 minutes and help me 
understand how well the State of Mozilla reflects your view of Mozilla. (If you’ve already received the survey through via email please respond to the 
email request.)</p>

<p>The survey has a place to write your thoughts as well as respond to specific questions to make things easy. And if for some reason the survey is difficult 
for you, it would be great if you could simply jump to the second to last question (if there anything else you’d like to say) and let us know about the 
difficulty.</p>

<p>The survey does not ask for your name. The survey does have an optional place for you to put any information you want us to know&mdash;your locale, 
your main roles within Mozilla, your name, or anything else you’d like us to know as we look at the responses.</p>

<p>Please help us make Mozilla the best we can be!</p>

<p>Thank you, Mitchell</p>
