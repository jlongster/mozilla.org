<dt><a name="what">What does it mean to be "Powered By Mozilla"?</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>The Powered by Mozilla logo is being made available for individuals and organizations that use parts of the Mozilla
code-base in their application or product.</p>
</dd>

<dt><a name="point">What's the point of having this program?</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>Making a Powered by Mozilla logo available will demonstrate how broadly Mozilla's technology is being adopted and will help
the community get a better understanding of who the users of Mozilla technology are.  Getting a wide range of applications
identified with this program can also be the first step in bringing more people into the community as active contributors.</p>
</dd>

<dt><a name="criteria">What criteria were used to pick the technologies for this program?</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>The following criteria have been used to determine which technologies to include in the program:</p>
<ul>
<li>The code should be an official and currently active Mozilla project</li>
<li>The code should be included in an official Mozilla product or should be packaged for re-use by other products</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><a name="technologies">What technologies are part of this program?</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>The following technologies are included in the Powered by Mozilla program:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/gecko">Gecko</a></li>
<li><a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/xulrunner">XULRunner</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If an application or product includes a substantial and material portion of one or more of these technologies, it will be
eligible to use the Powered by Mozilla logo.</p>
<p><i>Note: Additional technologies that meet the criteria above may be added to this program in the future.</i></p>
</dd>

<dt><a name="other">Why weren't other Mozilla technologies included in this program?</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>We decided to start this program with a limited set of technologies and to include additional parts of the
Mozilla codebase as the need arises.  If there is a technology that that you would like added to the program,
please <a href="/contact">let us know</a>.</p>
</dd>

<dt><a name="how">How can I get permission to use the Powered by Mozilla logo for my application?</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>To officially request use of the logo, please fill out this <a 
href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Marketing&amp;format=poweredby">form</a> or <a href="mailto:webmaster@mozilla.org">contact</a> 
us.</p>
</dd>

<dt><a name="formal">Why does there need to be a formal application process in order to use this logo?</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>There are unavoidable legal requirements that need to be dealt with when working with a trademark.  We need to ensure that
use of the mark is licensed and/or used with permission. Any license must also have a quality component, meaning the
products which bear a trademark must meet certain standards determined by the trademark owner. The mark should also not be
used in connection with products or services that are illegal, offensive, malicious, or harmful as such uses tarnish the
Mozilla brand. These terms may seem subjective, but the gist should be clear.</p>
<p>The trademark holder ultimately has the right to determine when and how the marks may be used, solely so that the
trademarks maintain their value and function as an identifier of both source and quality&mdash;the essence of a trademark. 
Thus, letting anyone use a trademark, at their own discretion, without precondition, renders the trademark meaningless and
is not a viable option.  Certainly unauthorized use of trademarks may sometimes occur, but that's a different issue.</p>
<p>In addition, any program we create should not result in a certification mark, like the Underwriters Laboratory UL mark,
where anyone who meets a defined set of tests may use the UL mark for any purpose and where the brand owner is actually
forbidden from using the UL mark for its own products.</p>
</dd>

<dt><a name="who">Who decides how the guidelines are applied?</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>A representative of the Mozilla Foundation will review all applications to make sure that no use of the Powered by Mozilla
logo would harm, dilute, or jeopardize the Mozilla brand as a whole or make the Mozilla brand meaningless.</p>
</dd>

<dt><a name="values">Could this program also be used to promote organizations or applications that support Mozilla's values?</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>The <a href="/about/manifesto">Mozilla Manifesto</a> sets out a set of values that are central to
the Mozilla community's activities.  A values-focused program could demonstrate how broadly the principles of the Mozilla
Manifesto are being adopted and could bring this message to new groups of people.  While promoting the values of the
Mozilla Manifesto is a worthwhile effort, we believe that trying to promote both technologies and values with the Powered
by Mozilla logo is impossible for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>it would be confusing to make one mark mean two very different things</li>
<li>it could potentially be very divisive to create guidelines that would require us to turn down someone's request to
use the logo for an application that uses XULRunner (for example) but doesn't advance the principles of the Manifesto</li>
<li>the phrase "Powered by" implies a technology, so this logo wouldn't lend itself to use by organizations or
individuals that support the Manifesto in ways that don't involve our technology (e.g. hosting events that spread the
idea of an open Internet to people in the developing world).</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><a name="extension">Can I use the Powered by Mozilla logo for my extension?</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>The Powered by Mozilla logo has been created for applications and products that reuse parts of the Mozilla codebase.  Extensions
that build on top of that code, but that don't embed any of that code, do not fit our current guidelines.  We are interested in
supporting extension developers if there is a desire to have a logo.</p>
</dd>

<dt><a name="firefox">Can these guidelines be used for a "Powered by Firefox" program?</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>The scope of this program is limited to Powered By Mozilla and is not intended to address issues related to the use of
Firefox, Bugzilla or other <a href="/foundation/trademarks/">Mozilla trademarks</a>.</p>
</dd>

<dt><a name="indicate">Are there other approved ways to use the Mozilla trademark to indicate that an application or product uses
Mozilla technologies?</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>If the Powered by Mozilla logo does not fit your needs, feel free to <a href="mailto:webmaster@mozilla.org">contact</a> us to 
discuss alternative options.</p>
</dd>
