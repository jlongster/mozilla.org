    <h1><a href="index.html">Visual Identity Guidelines</a>: Powered by Mozilla</h1>

    <h3>Powered by Mozilla Logo Usage</h3>
	<p>The Powered by Mozilla logo is to be displayed in its entirety on either a solid light or dark background (avoid mid-tone or strongly colored backgrounds). The logo should not be displayed in parts, with color variations or with other elements superimposed on top.</p>

	<div class="guidelines-figure">
	  <img src="powered-by-black-white.png" alt="Powered by Mozilla Logo" />
	  <p>Powered by Mozilla logo on <a href="powered-by-mozilla.png">white</a> (52 KB) and <a href="powered-by-mozilla-reversed.png">dark</a> (56 KB) background</p>
	</div>

	<p>The logo should not be displayed on screen at any smaller than 15px tall, and should follow the minimum clear space and color guidelines as shown below.</p>

	<div class="guidelines-figure">
     	  <img src="powered-by-grid.png" alt="Wordmark Grid" />
	  <p>Minimum clear space and color guidelines</p>
	</div>

	<p>It's also important to note that, to avoid the appearance of unsanctioned partnerships or co-branding, the logo should not be paired with or placed near logos or other corporate entities without Mozilla's prior approval.</p>

    <h3>Linking</h3>
	<p>When displayed online, the Powered by Mozilla logo should link back to the Mozilla Foundation's "Powered by" overview page at <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/poweredby">http://www.mozilla.org/poweredby</a>. This will give people a broader context of what the logo means and what Mozilla stands for.</p>

    <h3>Common Mistakes</h3>
	<p>The Powered by Mozilla logo should not be modified or displayed in ways that visually compromise it. Below are some common mistakes to avoid when using the logo:</p>

	<div class="guidelines-figure">
	  <img src="powered-by-logo-bad-examples.png" alt="Powered by Mozilla Logo Bad Examples" />
	  <p><strong>Common Wordmark Mistakes</strong> (clockwise from top-left):<br />incorrect font color, incorrect font type, strongly colored or patterned background, introducing new elements or logos, non-standard orientation and sizing of text or incomplete or altered wordmark</p>
	</div>
