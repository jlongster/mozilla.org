    <p>This FAQ attempts to answer a variety of questions that might
    be asked about the
    <a href="../feed-icon-guidelines/">feed icon usage guidelines</a>.</p>

    <h2>Feed icon basics</h2>

    <div class="qandaset">
      <div class="question"><p>What is the feed icon?</p></div>

      <div class="answer"><p>The feed icon was created originally for
      use with the
      <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/livebookmarks.html">Live Bookmarks</a>
      feature of the Mozilla Firefox browser. In that context the
      presence of the icon in association with a displayed web page
      indicates that information contained in the page is also
      available in the form of a web feed using the RSS or Atom web
      syndication formats.</p>

      <p>The Mozilla Foundation subsequently proposed having the icon
      be used universally in connection with feed-enabled applications
      or online services, blogs, news sites, and in general any web
      site offering information via open web syndication
      formats.</p></div>

      <div class="question"><p>Where can I get versions of the feed
      icon?</p></div>

      <div class="answer"><p>The <q>canonical</q> icon is available in
      a
      <a href="../../images/feed-icon-14x14.png" title="14 by 14-pixel canonical version of the feed icon">14x14-pixel version</a>
      and a
      <a href="../../images/feed-icon-28x28.png" title="28 by 28-pixel canonical version of the feed icon">28x28-pixel version</a>.
      You can also get high-resolution and variant versions through
      the
      <a href="http://www.feedicons.com/">feedicons.com web site</a>.</p></div>

      <div class="question"><p>Am I required to follow the proposed
      feed icon usage guidelines?</p></div>

      <div class="answer"><p>No. The proposed usage guidelines are not
      legally binding in any way. However we hope that users of the
      icon will honor the guidelines in the spirit in which they were
      intended.</p></div>

      <div class="question"><p>What&#8217;s the role of the wider
      community in all of this?</p></div>

      <div class="answer"><p>As noted above the proposed usage
      guidelines for the feed icon are not legally binding, and in
      general we don&#8217;t think that use of the icon should be
      regulated using trademark law and related mechanisms. Instead we
      propose relying on community oversight and enforcement of the
      guidelines using non-legal means.</p>

      <p>Community members are also invited to assist in determining
      the proper interpretation of the guidelines in particular
      situations, and evolving the guidelines and the icon itself to
      accomodate future uses not yet envisioned.</p></div>
    </div>

    <h2>Reasons and rationales</h2>

    <div class="qandaset">
      <div class="question"><p>Why publish any usage guidelines at
      all?</p></div>

      <div class="answer"><p>Because as
      <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/mitchell/archives/2006/06/what_do_icons_mean_part_1_1.html">we&#8217;ve previously discussed</a>,
      the Mozilla Foundation felt it was important that the icon
      <q>mean something</q> to people, particularly to end users who
      are just getting acquainted with the whole concept of web
      syndication and might see the icon as a relatively reliable
      guide by which to discover web feeds and ways to manipulate
      them. Taking a totally laissez faire approach might cause those
      users&#8217; expectations to be completely violated, for example
      by frequently encountering information in web syndication
      formats that were proprietary and could not be processed by most
      feed-enabled applications.</p></div>

      <div class="question"><p>Why do the proposed usage guidelines
      restrict use of the icon to open formats? Won&#8217;t that
      stifle innovation in future applications of web syndication
      formats?</p></div>

      <div class="answer"><div class="para"><p>We don&#8217;t believe
      so. We believe our proposed approach is consistent with
      encouraging innovation, for the following reasons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>The usage guidelines as proposed do not have a
        restrictive definition of the formats and protocols with which
        the icon may be used. In particular, the guidelines do not
        restrict use of the icon to the present-day RSS or Atom
        formats; in addition, the guidelines do not rule out the use
        of protocols other than HTTP to deliver web feeds.</p></li>

        <li><p>The usage guidelines as proposed do not rule out
        techniques like using proprietary media types for content
        items within a web feed published using an open web
        syndication format. Granted, if taken to an extreme such
        practices would lessen the usefulness of having open formats,
        but that&#8217;s a question for the broader community to
        consider in interpreting and evolving the guidelines.</p></li>

        <li><p>Finally, the guidelines are not legally binding. If you
        believe that the goal of innovation requires your defining and
        using partly or completely proprietary web syndication formats
        then you&#8217;re free both to do so and to use the icon in
        connection with those formats. However if you&#8217;ve
        previously publicly committed to comply with the guidelines
        then it&#8217;s up to you to justify to the broader community
        why you felt it necessary to act differently.</p></li>
      </ul></div></div>

      <div class="question"><p>Why do the proposed guidelines require
      that formats used in association with the icon be implementable
      by free and open source software developers?</p></div>

      <div class="answer"><p>Because the icon was originally created
      for use with free and open source software (FOSS), and because
      FOSS developers form a major part of the community promoting the
      use of web feeds for new and interesting applications. We
      don&#8217;t want there to be web syndication formats for which
      the icon is used but which we can&#8217;t implement (e.g., due
      to patent or other restrictions), and we believe other FOSS
      developers would agree.</p></div>

      <div class="question"><p>Why do the proposed guidelines require
      that formats used in association with the icon be developed
      and/or maintained using an open process?</p></div>

      <div class="answer"><p>Because ultimately it&#8217;s the broad
      community implementing and using web syndication formats that
      creates the value associated with the icon, and we don&#8217;t
      believe it&#8217;s fair to that community to use the icon in
      association with formats over which that community has no
      influence.</p></div>
    </div>

    <h2>Interpreting the guidelines</h2>

    <div class="qandaset">
      <div class="question"><p>I don&#8217;t like orange; can I use
      the feed icon in a different color?</p></div>

      <div class="answer"><p>As noted in the guidelines, we
      don&#8217;t intend to discourage alternative uses and
      representations of the icon that conform to the overall spirit
      of the guidelines, including using a different color for the
      icon in cases where you think it&#8217;s appropriate (e.g., to
      match the overall color scheme for your web site).</p>

      <p>However at the same time we believe that the color of the
      icon is an important visual cue for people, and that arbitrarily
      changing the color could disrupt that cue and could confuse
      users. (Just as, for example, changing the standard colors used
      for road signs could confuse drivers.) We therefore recommend
      <em>not</em> changing the color of the icon when it&#8217;s used
      in the context of feed readers and related products and
      services.</p></div>

      <div class="question"><p>Can I use the icon in association with
      web feeds that are subscription-only and/or fee-based?</p></div>

      <div class="answer"><p>Yes. The proposed requirement to use the
      icon in association only with open formats doesn&#8217;t imply
      that the content carried by the format must be made generally
      available.</p></div>

      <div class="question"><p>Can I use the icon in association with
      web feeds that include content that might itself be in
      proprietary formats and not necessarily anticipated in the
      format specification (e.g., for podcasting or
      photocasting)?</p></div>

      <div class="answer"><p>In principle yes, although particular
      instances of such practices may merit individual
      consideration. Open web syndication formats can be designed to
      allow for arbitrary content; for example, the atom:content
      element in Atom can be used for media types other than text and
      (X)HTML. Such open formats can also be designed to be extended
      in various ways, e.g., through Atom&#8217;s Simple Extension and
      Structured Extension elements.</p>

      <p>In some cases the additional media types and extension
      elements may be defined by open formats, and in some cases they
      may not be, In some cases the additional items may need to be
      interpreted by the application processing the feed, and in other
      cases they may not be (e.g., an audio or video media type might
      simply handed off to a third-party media player).</p>

      <p>Ultimately it&#8217;s up to the community to decide how far
      use of the icon should strech to cover <q>edge cases</q>
      involving the use of proprietary formats in certain
      contexts. For example, using the icon in association with a web
      feed including content items in proprietary formats arguably
      would <em>not</em> violate the spirit of the proposed usage
      guidelines. On the other hand, it <em>would</em> arguably
      violate the spirit of the guidelines to use the icon in
      association with a feed format that extended Atom in proprietary
      ways outside those allowed by Atom&#8217;s defined extension
      mechanisms. Other cases might be more ambiguous.</p></div>

      <div class="question"><p>What about cases where the entity
      making use of the icon doesn&#8217;t necessarily control the
      format of what&#8217;s being referenced by it (for example, a
      web portal that uses the icon to identify web feeds made
      available by third parties)?</p></div>

      <div class="answer"><p>In general individuals and organizations
      should be held responsible for their own actions, but
      can&#8217;t necessarily be held responsible for the actions of
      others. If a site states or implies that its web feeds are in
      open web syndication formats but this is not in fact the case,
      the fault lies with the site offering the feeds, not with others
      who might mistakenly or inadvertantly use the feed icon in
      association with the original site&#8217;s feeds.</p></div>

      <div class="question"><p>How can I report possible violations of
      the proposed usage guidelines?</p></div>

      <div class="answer"><p>That&#8217;s really up to you. If you
      think someone&#8217;s misusing the icon you can blog about it,
      post a note in an appropriate online forum (including the public
      <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.legal">mozilla.legal newsgroup</a>
      or the corresponding
      <a href="https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/legal">mailing list</a>),
      or notify anyone else whom you think might have an interest in
      the matter.</p></div>

      <div class="question"><p>How will violations of the proposed
      guidelines be punished?</p></div>

      <div class="answer"><p>As previously discussed the proposed feed
      icon usage guidelines are not legally binding, so no legal
      recourse is available against those who might violate the
      guidelines. However community members are certainly free to take
      other actions, such as directly complaining to the violator
      (e.g., to a corporation&#8217;s senior managers), publicizing
      the violations to other community members, the press, and the
      public at large, boycotting the violator&#8217;s products and
      services, and so on.</p></div>
