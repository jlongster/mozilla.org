2007 financial statement for the Mozilla Foundation and the Mozilla
Corporation</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What was Mozilla&#8217s total revenue for 2007?</p>

<p>Mozilla&#8217s revenues (including both Mozilla Foundation and
Mozilla Corporation) for 2007 were $75 million, up approximately 12%
from 2006 revenue of $67 million.</p></li>

<li><p>How does Mozilla generate revenue?</p>

<p>The vast majority of this revenue is associated with the search
functionality in Mozilla Firefox, and the majority of that is from
Google.  Mozilla takes in additional revenue from online affiliate
programs, the Mozilla Store, and interest and other income on our
invested assets.</p></li>

<li><p>Mozilla doesn&#8217t have a stock ticker to follow.  How do you
measure success?</p>

<p>We measure success by examining factors that reflect our growth
such as community code contributions, localizations, market share, the
number of nightly testers, and total users.  We are committed to
promoting openness and participation on the Internet and demonstrating
that the Open Web is the most fundamental platform for ongoing
development.</p></li>

<li><p>Why is the growth in your claimed user base is not reflected in
revenue growth?</p>

<p>This is because search revenue increased at a lesser rate than
Firefox usage growth as the rate of payment declines with
volume.</p></li>

<li><p>Is Mozilla poised for continued growth through 2008 and
beyond?</p>

<p>Our financial objectives are for sustainability and our basic
structure &ndash; public benefit, non-profit &ndash; means that we can
continue with relative stability.  We&#8217ve been building in the
ability to live with greatly reduced revenue for years. Mozilla has a
significant amount of retained earnings.</p></li>

<li><p>What is the status of your contract with Google?</p>

<p>The agreement between Google and the Mozilla Corporation that
accounts for the bulk of the revenue has been renewed for an
additional three years, and is now slated to expire at the end of
November of 2011.</p></li>

<li><p>Your partnership with Google accounts for over 88% of your 2007
revenue. How does this affect your independence?</p>

<p>We develop our product and technical direction as part of an open
process unrelated to the search relationship with Google. Mozilla
teams do collaborate with Google teams on parts of the product that
offer Google services (i.e., the Firefox Start Page) and the services
they provide, like anti-phishing. We do not vet our initiatives with
Google.</p></li>

<li><p>Are you exploring opportunities to diversify your revenue
stream?</p>

<p>Mozilla has always focused on building open products that people
love, in ways that are participatory, and then developing revenue to
support that work. For long-term financial viability, we will of
course look carefully at ways to diversify our revenue mix over
time. It&#8217s an important concept, although our current contract
with Google gives us a firm base for the next three years. We&#8217ll
continue to build great products that help people enjoy the richness
of the Internet, and we&#8217re confident that this allows us to
identify appropriate sources of revenue diversification.</p></li>
