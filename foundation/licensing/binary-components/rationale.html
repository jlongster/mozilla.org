<h3>Direct 3D DLL</h3>

<p>The Microsoft D3D9X DLL is an example of an application of the <a href="./">binary components</a> policy. To provide a good <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL">WebGL</a> experience to Windows users with Intel graphics cards we planned on shipping <a href="http://code.google.com/p/angleproject/">ANGLE</a>, an open source library,  which translates WebGL/OpenGL to Direct3D 9.  However, one of the pieces that ANGLE depends on is the D3D9X library provided by Microsoft. This library is not available in default Windows installs. Microsoft permits either the creation of a 2.5-3MB separate installer that all Windows users would need to execute when installing Firefox (which would increase download time and complexity and be a poor user experience), or bundling the required 800k DLL with the product (as we have chosen to do). The Intel graphics cards are estimated to represent 50% of the graphic cards market; thus itâ€™s a relevant portion of users. In addition, the D3D9X library also supports the long term adoption of WebGL as an open standard for 3D rendering on the web.</p>
