<dt><a name="how">How will my donation be used?</a></dt>
<dd> 
<p>The Mozilla Foundation conducts a number of <a href="activities.html">activities</a> in support of the <a
href="http://www.mozilla.org/about/mozilla-manifesto.html">Mozilla Manifesto</a>. Unless otherwise specified by you,
the Mozilla Foundation's Board of Directors will choose which of these activities to support with your
donation.</p>
</dd>

<dt><a name="directed">Can I choose a specific project in the community to support?</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>Yes.  The Mozilla Foundation allows people to donate to specific projects through our 
<a href="http://mozilla.bluestatedigital.com/page/content/donate">Directed Giving Program</a>. 
<p> Donations that are given to a specific project will be used by the Mozilla Foundation to fund activities
related to that project.  The Mozilla Foundation may use any directed donation for other purposes if the
Board of Directors is unable to find suitable activities to fund for a project, if a project becomes inactive
or otherwise becomes ineligible to receive funds.</p>
</dd>

<dt><a name="currency">Can I donate in a currency other than United States dollars?</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>Yes.  We welcome donations from anywhere in the world and in any currency. Paypal accepts a number of
international currencies and we are able to accept checks in non-USD currencies. You may also donate
in euros directly to <a href="http://www.mozilla-europe.org/en/contribute/">Mozilla Europe</a>.
</dd>

<dt><a name="mydonation">Does the Mozilla Foundation need my donation?</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>Yes. In order to promote the goals of the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/about/mozilla-manifesto.html">Mozilla Manifesto</a> we need more
people involved in and engaged with the Mozilla project. Not everyone has the time to participate in project activities like testing, bug
fixing, evangelism; by donating to the Foundation you can not only support <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/activities.html">current
activities</a> but can also help determine which activities we undertake in the future. By soliciting donations and providing ways for you to
indicate your preferences as to how those donations might be used, we learn what activities and projects you want to support, and we can match
that support accordingly.</p>

<p>We also believe it's important for individual projects within the overall Mozilla project (e.g., Bugzilla and
others) to be able to develop their own identities and build their own communities of people who support those
projects, not just through code and related contributions but financially as well. Your donations can help such
projects undertake new activities to better serve their users.</p>

<p>In general the Mozilla Foundation devotes its resources to promoting openness, innovation and opportunity on the
Internet in ways that will benefit everyone. Your donations will not only enable us to continue our current
activities that support these goals, but will also allow us to develop new programs that will support the Mozilla
community and the open Internet.</p>
</dd>

<dt><a name="deductible">Is my donation tax deductible?</a></dt> 
<dd>
<p>The Mozilla Foundation is a California non-profit corporation exempt from federal income taxation under
IRC 501(c)3. Donations are tax deductible for United States citizens. For donors outside of the United States,
please consult with your tax advisor about whether your donation will be tax deductible.</p>
