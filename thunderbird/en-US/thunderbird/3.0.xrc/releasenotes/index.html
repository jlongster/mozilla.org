            <ul class="spaced">
              <li>New Mail Account Setup Wizard
                <p>The new Mail Account Setup Wizard matches against a database of email settings from popular mail providers so that you will only need to provide your name, email, and password to set up new mail accounts. </p>
              </li>
              <li>Redesigned Mail Toolbar
                <p>The Mail Toolbar is redesigned to include the new Global Search bar. Buttons such as reply, forward, delete, junk are part of each email message. You can add those buttons back to the main toolbar by customizing the toolbar.</p>
              </li>
              <li>Tabbed Email
                Messages
                <p>Double-clicking or hitting enter on a mail message will now open that message in a New Tab window. Middle-clicking on messages or folders will open them in a Tab in the background. When quitting Thunderbird, visible tabs will be saved and will be restored when you open Thunderbird the next time. There is also a new Tab menu on the Tab toolbar to help you switch between Tabs. </p>
              </li>
              <li>Smart Folders
                <p>The folder pane offers a Smart Folders mode which combines special mailboxes, like Inbox, from multiple accounts. Smart Folders is now on by default. </p>
              </li>
              <li>New Message Summary
                View
                <p>Selecting multiple messages will give you a summary view of the emails you have selected. </p>
              </li>
              <li>Column Headings
                <p>The column headings that are displayed and the order in which they are displayed can now be set on a per-folder basis.</p>
              </li>
              <li>Message Archive
                <p>You can now file messages from your Inbox or other folders into the new Archive folder system. </p>
              </li>
              <li>Activity Manager

              </li>
              <li>New Add-ons Manager
                <p>The new Add-ons Manager (Tools &gt; Add-ons) can now be used to find, download, and install Thunderbird Add-ons which includes Extensions, Themes, and Plugins.</p>
              </li>
              <li>Improved Address Book
                <p>If someone is in your address book, it is indicated by a new star icon which you can click to edit contact details inline.  If they are not in your address book, you can add them with one click of the icon.  A new birthday field allows you to keep track of your friends' birthdays. You can also add a photo for contacts in your address book.</p>
              </li>
              <li>Improved Gmail Integration
                <p>Better recognition and integration of Gmail's special folders such as Sent and Trash including non-English versions of Gmail. Thunderbird also uses All Mail as the Archives folder.</p>
              </li>
              <li>For Windows Vista users, Thunderbird 3 is now integrated with Vista search results.  On first start, Thunderbird will prompt
                to install its indexing system into Windows Vista and you can choose to see Thunderbird email and news
                messages in Windows search results. </li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="spaced">

            <h3>Performance Improvements</h3>
            <ul class="spaced">
              <li>IMAP Folder Synchronization
                <p>Thunderbird will download IMAP messages by default in the background to allow for faster message loading and better offline operation. This feature can be enabled on an individual folder basis via Folder properties, or for all folders in an account via Account Settings / 'Synchronize &amp; Storage'.</p>

              <li>Your passwords are stored in a new location. If you go back to using a previous version of Thunderbird, or switch back and forth between Thunderbird 3 and an older version, your password lists do not get updated.</li>
              <li>Searching your emails is case sensitive for languages other than English. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=525537">Bug 525537</a>)</li>
              <li>If using SSL or TLS, and the certificate that

                does not match the server domain, a dialog will be shown asking if
                Thunderbird should permanently make an exception for the cert.

              <li>The extended columns in the folder pane were

              <li>The compact header view was removed in Thundebird 3 Beta 3 (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=480623">Bug 480623</a>); see <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/dmose/archives/2009/07/thunderbird_30b3_shipped.html">this blog entry</a> for details.

              <li>Some Thunderbird 2 users upgrading to Thunderbird 3 may not be able to login to their smtp server because the secure authentication setting maybe turned on but not supported by the smtp server. Check your smtp server settings in Tools -&gt; Account Settings -&gt; Outgoing Server, and edit the smtp server with the issue. If use 'secure authentication' is checked, uncheck it and try again. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=522633">Bug 522633</a>)</li>
              <li>Thunderbird requires that extensions either come from a secure server using the HTTPS protocol or are digitally signed, or they will fail to install.</li>
              <li>If you are unable to view content for your RSS feeds in the Wide View Layout, you may need to disable the Lightning Calendar add-on if you have it installed or switch to Classic View and restart Thunderbird.

      <h3 class="expander-header">Troubleshooting</h3>
      <div class="expander-content">
		    <ul class="spaced">
		      <li> Poorly designed or incompatible extensions can cause problems with your email client, including make it crash, slow down message display, etc. If you encounter strange problems relating to parts of the email client no longer working, the email client not starting, windows with strange or distorted appearance, degraded performance, etc, you may be suffering from Extension or Theme trouble.
		        Restart the email client in Safe Mode. On Windows, start using the &quot;Safe Mode&quot; shortcut created in your
		        Start menu or by running <code>thunderbird.exe -safe-mode</code>. On Linux, 
		        start with <code>./thunderbird -safe-mode</code> and on Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X, run:
		        <p><code> cd /Applications/Thunderbird.app/Contents/MacOS/<br />
		          ./thunderbird-bin -safe-mode </code></p>
		        When started in Safe Mode all extensions are disabled and the Default theme is used. Disable the Extension/Theme that is causing trouble and then start normally. </li>
		      <li>
                <p>If you encounter strange problems relating to email, feeds or newsgroup messages, it is recommended that you try
                  creating a new profile and attempting to reproduce the problem before filing
                  bugs. Create a new profile by running Thunderbird with the -P command line
                  argument, choose the &quot;Manage Profiles&quot; button and then choose &quot;Create
                  Profile...&quot;. Migrate your settings files (Emails, feeds, etc) over
                  one by one, checking each time to see if the problems resurface. If you do
                  find a particular profile data file is causing a problem, file a bug and attach
                  the file, being sure to remove any private information as necessary.</p>
