      <p><a href="<?=url('/thunderbird/3.0b1/')?>">Thunderbird 3 Beta 1</a> is a preview release of the next major
         version of Thunderbird. It is available for testing purposes only and is intended for developers and our
         testing community. </p>

   <p>This release does not represent the final product.  Some of the
     features listed below are highly experimental and will likely change
     before the final release. They may come with crashes and bugs and may
     potentially cause data loss in profiles (configuration data, preferences,
     and downloaded mail). </p>

   <p><strong>Please do not use Thunderbird&nbsp;3 Beta&nbsp;1 in a production
      environment.</strong></p>

    <h2 id="whatsnew">What's New in Thunderbird&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;1</h2>
    <p>Thunderbird&nbsp;3 Beta&nbsp;1 is based on the Gecko 1.9.1 platform
        which has more than 10,000 updates
        including some major re-architecting to provide improved performance,
        stability, web compatibility, and code simplification and sustainability.      </p>
    <p>There are over 750 changes in this release, many laying the groundwork
        for future changes. Some notable changes include:</p>
        <h3 id="user-experience">User Experience Improvements</h3>
        <ul class="spaced">
          <li>Tabbed Email <br />
            <p>Email messages, folders, and calendars (with the Lightning extension
               installed) can be opened in tabs.            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
          Improved Message Reader View
          <p>This is the first stage of a series of refinements to the message reading
            experience. The first stage brings email controls closer to the area in which
            the user is operating.          </p>
          </li>
          <li>New Add-ons Manager
            <p>The new Add-ons Manager (Tools &gt; Add-ons) can now be used to find, download, and install Thunderbird Add-ons which includes Extensions, Themes, and Plugins. Note that few Add-ons are compatible with this beta at the time of release, as Add-on developers need to upgrade them.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Improved Address Book
              <p>If someone is in your address book, it is indicated by a new star icon which you can click to edit contact details inline.  If they are not in your address book, you can add them with one click of the icon.  A new birthday field allows you to keep track of your friends' birthdays.</p>
          </li>
          <li>For Windows Vista users, Thunderbird 3 Beta 1 is now integrated with Vista search results.  On first start, Thunderbird will prompt
              to install its indexing system into Windows Vista and you can choose to see Thunderbird email and news
              messages in Windows search results.          </li>
        </ul>
<ul class="spaced">
          <li>
            For Mac users,&nbsp;Thunderbird 3 Beta 1 can import from Mail.app,
            read your OS X address book, and use Growl for new mail alerts.          </li>
    </ul>
<h3 id="performance">Performance improvements</h3>
        <ul class="spaced">
          <li>Faster Message Loading for IMAP
            <p>
              Thunderbird will now download IMAP messages in the background to
              allow for faster message loading, and better offline operation. This feature can be enabled
              on an individual folder basis (via folder properties), or for all folders in an account, 
              via Account Settings / Sync &amp; Disk Space.            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>

    <h2 id="downloadandinstall">Downloading and Installing</h2>

      <h3 id="requirements">System Requirements</h3>

      <p>Before installing, make sure your computer meets the <a href="../../system-requirements/">

         system requirements</a>.</p>
      <p>Please note that Thunderbird&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;1 no longer supports versions of Windows prior to Windows 2000 (e.g. Windows 95, 98, ME and NT)  and Mac OS X versions prior to 10.4 Tiger. Linux requirements have also changed. Do ensure that compatibility mode for unsupported Windows platforms is disabled for the Thunderbird executable in Windows.</p>
    <h3 id="download">Downloading Thunderbird&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;1</h3>
    <p>
      Mozilla Messaging provides Thunderbird&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;1 for Windows, Linux, and Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X in a
         variety of languages. You can <a href="../../early_releases/downloads/">get
         the latest beta version of Thunderbird 3 here</a>.</p>

    <h3 id="install">Installing Thunderbird&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;1</h3>
    <p>Please note that installing Thunderbird&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;1 <em>may overwrite</em> your
         existing installation of Thunderbird on Linux. Windows and Mac OS X will install to different locations, however
         it is recommended that you check the messages during installation. For all systems, you won't lose 
         any of your messages or address books, but some of your extensions and other add-ons might 
         not work until updates for them are made available.</p>
         
    <p>Users are highly encouraged to install Thunderbird&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;1 in another folder (on Windows, this is done using Custom Install) and backup their profiles before testing Thunderbird&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;1.</p>

    <h3 id="uninstall">Removing Thunderbird&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;1</h3>

    <p>You can remove Thunderbird&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;1 through the <tt>Control Panel</tt> in the
         <tt>Start Menu</tt> on Windows, by removing the <tt>Thunderbird</tt> application on 
         OS X, or by removing the <tt>thunderbird</tt> folder on Linux.</p>

      <p>Removing Thunderbird&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;1 won't remove your emails or newsgroup messages. This data is stored in your <em>profile
         folder</em>, which is located in one of the following locations depending on
         your operating system:</p>

      <table style="font-size: small;" border="1" cellspacing="0">
        <tr>
          <td>Windows Vista</td>
          <td>Users\&lt;UserName&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Windows 2000, XP, Server 2003</td>
          <td>Documents and Settings\&lt;UserName&gt;\Application Data\Thunderbird</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

          <td>Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X</td>
          <td>~/Library/Thunderbird</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Linux and Unix systems</td>

          <td>~/.thunderbird</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Any version of Thunderbird that you install after removing Thunderbird&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;1 will
         continue to use the data from this profile folder.</p>

      <h3 id="extensions">Extensions and Themes</h3>

      <p>
        Extensions installed under previous versions of Thunderbird may be incompatible and/or require
        updates to work with Thunderbird&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;1. Please report any issues to the
        maintainer of the extension.</p>

      <p>When you install Thunderbird&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;1 all of your Extensions and Themes will be
        disabled until Thunderbird&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;1 determines that either a) they are compatible
        with the Thunderbird&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;1 release or b) there are newer versions available that
        are compatible.</p>

    <h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>

      <ul class="spaced">
        <li>
          Poorly designed or incompatible extensions can cause problems with your email client, including make it crash, slow down message display, etc. If you encounter strange problems relating to parts of the email client no longer working, the email client not starting, windows with strange or distorted appearance, degraded performance, etc, you may be suffering from Extension or Theme trouble.
          Restart the email client in Safe Mode. On Windows, start using the &quot;Safe Mode&quot; shortcut created in your
          Start menu or by running <code>thunderbird.exe -safe-mode</code>. On Linux, 
          start with <code>./thunderbird -safe-mode</code> and on Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X, run:
          <p><code>

            cd /Applications/Thunderbird.app/Contents/MacOS/<br />
            ./thunderbird-bin -safe-mode
          </code></p>

          When started in Safe Mode all extensions are disabled and the Default theme is used. Disable the Extension/Theme that is causing trouble and then start normally.        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If you encounter strange problems relating to email, feeds or newsgroup messages, it is recommended that you try
          creating a new profile and attempting to reproduce the problem before filing
          bugs. Create a new profile by running Thunderbird with the -P command line
          argument, choose the &quot;Manage Profiles&quot; button and then choose &quot;Create
          Profile...&quot;. Migrate your settings files (Emails, feeds, etc) over
          one by one, checking each time to see if the problems resurface. If you do
          find a particular profile data file is causing a problem, file a bug and attach
          the file, being sure to remove any private information as necessary.</p>
