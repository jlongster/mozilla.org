        <li>New Migration Assistant</li>
        <li>Saved Files Manager</li>
        <li>Several fixes to improve upgrading from Thunderbird 2</li>
        <li>Several design improvements and corrections to the interface</li>
        <li>Stability, memory, and password handling improvements</li>
      </ul>
