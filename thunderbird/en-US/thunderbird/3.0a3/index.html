      <h2 id="features">New Features and Changes</h2>

      <p>New Features and changes in this milestone that require feedback include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Improved Message Reader View
            <p>This is the first stage of a series of improvements to refine the message reading
            experience; the first stage brings email controls closer to area in which
            the user is operating.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Add/Edit Contacts from the Message Header
            <p>We now provide at-a-glance indication if someone is already in your
            address book, if they are not, you add them with one click. You can also
            edit contact details inline.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Integrated Vista Search
            <p>Windows Vista users can now choose to see Thunderbird email and news messages
            in Windows search results.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Automatic Message Download for IMAP
            <p>Thunderbird will now download IMAP messages in the background to
            allow for faster message loading, and better off-line operation.
            See the <a href="releasenotes/">release notes</a> for details on
            enabling this feature.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Birthday Field in Address Book
            <p>You can now enter the dates of your contacts birthdays into the address book.</p>
