      <p>Miramar Alpha 1, <a href="../early_releases/downloads/">available now for download</a>, is built on top of the Gecko 2.0 platform. While this milestone is considered to be stable, it is intended for developers and members of our testing community to use for evaluation and feedback. Users of this latest alpha version of Thunderbird should not expect all of their add-ons to work properly with this milestone. </p>
      <p>The main goals of this release is to find out about possible problems
        caused by the changes in the underlying platform.  Notable changes include:</p>
      <ul class="spaced">
        <li>New Addons Manager and extension management API (user interface will be changed before final release).</li>
        <li>Attachment sizes now displayed along with attachments.</li>
        <li>Several user interface fixes for Windows Vista/Windows 7.</li>
        <li>Support for Mac 32/64 bit Universal builds (Miramar Alpha 1 will no longer support PowerPC on Mac).</li>
        <li>Over 190 platform fixes to improve performance and stability.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For a more detailed list of bug fixes, see the <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=ALL%20+milestone:%22Thunderbird%203.3a1%22%20+resolution:FIXED%20-status-thunderbird3.1:fixed%20-status-thunderbird3.0:fixed">the full bug list</a>.</p>
