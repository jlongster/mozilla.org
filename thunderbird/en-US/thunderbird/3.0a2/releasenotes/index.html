    <h2 id="downloadandinstall">Downloading and Installing</h2>

      <h3 id="requirements">System Requirements</h3>

      <p>Before installing, make sure your computer meets the <a href="../../system-requirements/">

         system requirements</a>.</p>
      <p>Please note that Shredder Alpha 2 no longer supports versions of Windows prior to Windows 2000 (e.g. Windows 95, 98, ME and NT)  and Mac OS X versions prior to 10.4 Tiger. Linux requirements have also changed. Do ensure that compatibility mode for unsupported Windows platforms is disabled for the Thunderbird executable in Windows.</p>
    <h3 id="download">Downloading Shredder&nbsp;Alpha&nbsp;2</h3>
    <p>Mozilla Messaging provides Shredder&nbsp;Alpha&nbsp;2 for Windows, Linux, and Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X in a
         variety of languages. You can <a href="../../early_releases/downloads/">get the latest early release of
         Shredder/Thunderbird here</a>.</p>

    <h3 id="install">Installing Shredder&nbsp;Alpha 2</h3>
      <p>Please note that installing Shredder&nbsp;Alpha 2 <em>will overwrite</em> your
         existing installation of Thunderbird on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. For all systems, you won't lose 
         any of your messages or address books, but some of your extensions and other add-ons might 
         not work until updates for them are made available.</p>
         
      <p>Users are highly encouraged to install Shredder Alpha 2 in another folder (on Windows, this is done using Custom Install) and backup their profiles before testing Shredder Alpha 2.</p>

    <h3 id="uninstall">Removing Shredder&nbsp;Alpha 2</h3>

    <p>You can remove Shredder&nbsp;Alpha 2 through the <tt>Control Panel</tt> in the
         <tt>Start Menu</tt> on Windows, by removing the <tt>Thunderbird</tt> application on 
         OS X, or by removing the <tt>thunderbird</tt> folder on Linux.</p>

      <p>Removing Shredder&nbsp;Alpha 2 won't remove your emails or newsgroup messages. This data is stored in your <em>profile
         folder</em>, which is located in one of the following locations depending on
         your operating system:</p>

      <table style="font-size: small;" border="1" cellspacing="0">
        <tr>
          <td>Windows Vista</td>
          <td>Users\&lt;UserName&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Windows 2000, XP, Server 2003</td>
          <td>Documents and Settings\&lt;UserName&gt;\Application Data\Thunderbird</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

          <td>Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X</td>
          <td>~/Library/Thunderbird</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Linux and Unix systems</td>

          <td>~/.thunderbird</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Any version of Thunderbird that you install after removing Shredder Alpha 2 will
         continue to use the data from this profile folder.</p>

      <h3 id="extensions">Extensions and Themes</h3>

      <p>Extensions installed under previous versions of Thunderbird may be incompatible and/or require 
         updates to work with Shredder&nbsp;Alpha 2. Please report any issues to the 
         maintainer of the extension.</p>

      <p>When you install Shredder Alpha 2 all of your Extensions and Themes will be 
         disabled until Shredder&nbsp;Alpha 2 determines that either a) they are compatible 
         with the Shredder&nbsp;Alpha 2 release or b) there are newer versions available that 
         are compatible.</p>

    <h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>

      <ul class="spaced">
        <li>
          Poorly designed or incompatible extensions can cause problems with your email client, including make it crash, slow down message display, etc. If you encounter strange problems relating to parts of the email client no longer working, the email client not starting, windows with strange or distorted appearance, degraded performance, etc, you may be suffering from Extension or Theme trouble.
          Restart the email client in Safe Mode. On Windows, start using the &quot;Safe Mode&quot; shortcut created in your
          Start menu or by running <code>thunderbird.exe -safe-mode</code>. On Linux, 
          start with <code>./thunderbird -safe-mode</code> and on Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X, run:
          <p><code>

            cd /Applications/Thunderbird.app/Contents/MacOS/<br />
            ./thunderbird-bin -safe-mode
          </code></p>

          When started in Safe Mode all extensions are disabled and the Default theme is used. Disable the Extension/Theme that is causing trouble and then start normally.        </li>
        <li>
          If you encounter strange problems relating to email, feeds or newsgroup messages, it is recommended that you try
          creating a new profile and attempting to reproduce the problem before filing
          bugs. Create a new profile by running Thunderbird with the -P command line
          argument, choose the &quot;Manage Profiles&quot; button and then choose &quot;Create
          Profile...&quot;. Migrate your settings files (Emails, feeds, etc) over
          one by one, checking each time to see if the problems resurface. If you do
          find a particular profile data file is causing a problem, file a bug and attach
          the file, being sure to remove any private information as necessary.</li>
