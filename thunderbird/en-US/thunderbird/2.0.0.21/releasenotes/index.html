	        <ul class="spaced">
	          <li>If you were using the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/thunderbird/addon/106">Buttons! Extension</a> with Thunderbird 1.5.0.x and then upgraded to Thunderbird 2,
	              you will see a gray box at the bottom of the main Thunderbird window containing the text:  "----------------^&lt;menuitem". To fix this problem disable or download the 
	              latest version of the Buttons! extension.</li>
	          <li>If you were using the ScheduleWorld extension with Thunderbird 1.5.0.x and your folders disappeared when you updated to Thunderbird 2, please disable this extension and restart Thunderbird.
	              Your folders should now show up again.</li>
	          <li>Some firewall software may silently block Thunderbird from running. This often happens immediately after Thunderbird has been installed or updated from a previous version. There are <a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Firewalls">configuration instructions</a> available for most popular firewall programs to help you ensure that Thunderbird is allowed to connect to the Internet.</li>
	          <li>Software Update will not work if Thunderbird is installed to a location on your disk to which you do not have write access, since Software Update needs to replace or create files in this location.</li>
	          <li>Dictionaries can be installed as extensions from: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/thunderbird/dictionaries/?lang=<?=$lang?>">addons.mozilla.org</a>.</li>
	          <li>The mail views toolbar button is no longer a default toolbar button. Users of this feature must add it back to their default toolbar in the mail 3-pane window: View / Toolbars / Customize.</li>
	          <li>In order to take advantage of Thunderbird's ability to adjust the online state based on your network connectivity, you must first change the value of <tt>network.autodial-helper.enabled</tt> to false.</li>
	          <li>When switching between using a Global Inbox and using an Inbox for a POP3 account, be sure to make copies of the messages into another folder.</li>
	          <li>A compatible version of DOM Inspector is now available for Extension and Theme developers at: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/thunderbird/1806/">https://addons.mozilla.org/thunderbird/1806/</a>.</li>

      <h3 class="expander-header">Troubleshooting</h3>
      <div class="expander-content">
		    <ul class="spaced">
		      <li>Occasionally, Extensions may cause problems with Thunderbird, including reduced stability and performance. If you encounter problems relating to parts of the mail client no longer working, the mail client not starting, windows with strange or distorted appearance, degraded performance, etc., you may be suffering from Extension or Theme trouble. Restart the mail client in Safe Mode. On Windows, start using the "Safe Mode" shortcut created in your Start menu or by running <code>thunderbird.exe -safe-mode</code>. On Linux, start with <code>./thunderbird -safe-mode</code> and on Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X, run:
		        <p><code>
		          cd /Applications/Thunderbird.app/Contents/MacOS/<br />
		          ./thunderbird-bin -safe-mode
		        </code></p>
		      When started in Safe Mode all extensions are disabled and the Default theme is used. Disable the Extension/Theme that is causing trouble and then start normally.</li>
