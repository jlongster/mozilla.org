      <h3><a name="install">Installing Thunderbird</a></h3>
      <p>Once you have downloaded a Thunderbird installer or compressed archive, follow 
         these instructions to install:</p> <br />                           
      <h3>Windows</h3>
      <p>Double click the <tt class="filename">Thunderbird Setup 1.5 Beta 1.exe</tt> installer to 
         start the install.</p>
      <h3>MacOS X</h3>
      <p>Once you have downloaded the Thunderbird 1.5 Beta 1.dmg file, double click the Thunderbird Disk Image 
         to open it in Finder, and then drag the Thunderbird application onto your hard disk. 
         Drag the icon to your Dock if you want it to appear there.</p>
      <h3>Other Platforms</h3>
      <p>Extract the compressed archive and run <tt>thunderbird</tt></p>
      
      <h3 id="uninstall">Uninstalling Thunderbird</h3>
      <p>To uninstall Thunderbird, follow these instructions:</p>
      <h3>Windows</h3>
      <p>From the <kbd>Start</kbd> menu, choose <kbd>Control Panel</kbd>. When the 
         Control Panel appears, double click <kbd>Add/Remove Programs</kbd>. Find 
         "Mozilla Thunderbird (1.4)" in the list and click <kbd>Remove</kbd> to uninstall.</p>
      <h3>MacOS X</h3>
      <p>Drag the <tt class="filename">Thunderbird</tt> application to the Trash.</p>
      <h3>Others</h3>
      <p>Remove the <tt class="filename">thunderbird</tt> folder.</p>
      <p>These instructions leave your profile in place in case you install Thunderbird 
         again in the future. If you wish to remove your profile folder, remove 
         the location described below in the <strong>"Profile Folder"</strong> section. 
         Note that by doing this you are destroying all of your email, address book data,
         settings and other information and should you decide to use Thunderbird again you
         will be starting with a clean profile.</p>
                  
      <h2>Other Information</h2>
      <h3 id="profilefolder">Profile Folder</h3>
      <p>Thunderbird stores your user data in one of the following locations:</p>

      <h2><a name="issues">Known Issues</a></h2>
      <p>This list covers some of the known problems with Thunderbird 1.5 Beta 1. Please read this
         before reporting any new bugs, and watch it regularly (we'll update it as new 
         bugs are found in the release).</p>

      <h3 id="extensions">Extensions and Themes</h3>
      <p>You may run into issues with our new Extension Compatibility and Update mechanism. 
         There are simple workarounds for each of the three problems we're aware of.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If after you run the Thunderbird 1.5 Beta installer, the extension compatibility and update wizard does not appear, 
            go to the Extension Manager and manually check for updates.</li>
        <li>If the Extension Compatibility and Update wizard appears but does not complete, 
            first try to focus some other window and return focus to the wizard. If that does not 
            correct the problem, hit Cancel and go to the Extension Manager and manually check for updates.
        </li>
        <li>If the Extension Compatibility and Update wizard downloads and installs extension updates 
            but those updates are not applied, open the Extension Manager and manually check for updates.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Extensions installed under Thunderbird 1.0 may be incompatible and/or require updates to 
         work with Thunderbird 1.5 Beta. Please report any issues to the maintainer of the extension. 
         When you install Thunderbird 1.5 Beta all of your Extensions and Themes may be disabled until 
         Thunderbird 1.5 Beta determines that either a) they are compatible with the 1.5 Beta release or 
         b) there are newer versions available that are compatible. This is because Thunderbird changes from 
         release to release and as such the ways in which some extensions integrate changes, meaning there 
         can be problems when running an older extension with a newer version of Thunderbird. If you find that 
         your favorite Extension or Theme has not been updated to be compatible with this release of Thunderbird, 
         write the author and encourage them to update it.
      </p>  
          
      <h3>All Systems</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Prior to installing Thunderbird 1.5 Beta 1, please ensure that the directory you've 
          chosen to install into is clean and doesn't contain any previous Thunderbird 
          installations.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you install Thunderbird on a multi-user system in an area in which there is
          restricted access privileges, you must run Thunderbird as a user with access to
          that location upon installation so that all initial startup files are generated.
          If this is not done, when a user without write access to the install location
          attempts to start Thunderbird, they will not have sufficient privileges to allow
          Thunderbird to generate the initial startup files it needs to.
        </li>
        <li>
          When upgrading, all your Extensions and Themes will be disabled. This is not
          an issue, but it may appear to be one (hence its listing here). For rationale,
          see "Extension and Themes" above.
        </li>        
        <li>
          The default dictionary is English-only. To add a non-English dictionary, read 
          the <a href="../dictionaries.html">installation instructions</a>.
        </li>
        <li>In the new Options dialog, several menulist options cannot be changed
            including: The ability to change the addressbook we add outgoing
            messages to and the address book used to allow remote images.
        </li>
        <li>When another application opens a mail compose window in Thunderbird, there
            are issues with keys being disabled (such as the arrow keys). To work around this issue, 
            click on another window and then bring focus back to the compose window.
        </li>
        <li>
          When switching between using a Global Inbox and using an Inbox for a POP3 account, be sure to 
          make copies of the messages into another folder.
        </li>
        <li>Software Update will not work if Thunderbird is installed to a location
            that you do not have write access to, since Software Update needs to
            replace or create files in this location.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Windows</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When installing as a restricted access user on a shared machine into a location
          that you can write to, there may still be negative side effects (default 
          email/other keys not being set correctly). The email client should still function 
          however. When installing as a restricted access user do <strong>not</strong>
          attempt to install over an installation in a restricted-access/shared location 
          as this may destroy that installation.
        </li>
<!--         
        <li>
          Windows users can sync their address book with a Palm device by installing the 
          <a href="http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/thunderbird/extensions/palmsync/palmsync.xpi">Palm Sync extension</a>
          for Thunderbird. Save the file locally and install it from the extensions dialog in Thunderbird. The extension will
          not show up in the list of extensions. You will have to restart Thunderbird after installing the extension
          before it will take effect.
        </li>
-->        
      </ul>
          
      <h3>MacOS X</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Do NOT run Thunderbird from the Disk Image!</strong> - doing this will
          cause an infinite restart loop (the symptom of which is a Thunderbird icon that
          bounces briefly in the Dock then disappears and reappears, bounces and 
          disappears, over and over). To break Thunderbird out of this loop, open a 
          Terminal and type "killall thunderbird-bin" and press enter. Install Thunderbird to
          a location you have write access to and try again. When installing on a multi-
          user limited access system, install it into a shared location as administrator,
          run it once and then all users should be able to access it. 
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Linux and Unix systems</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          GNOME integration does not work properly with Fedora Core 3. 
          Users of Fedora Core 3 will need to download and install
          <a href="http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/core/2/i386/os/Fedora/RPMS/linc-1.0.3-3.1.i386.rpm">linc-1.0.3-3.1.i386.rpm</a>.
          After installing the RPM, perform the following command in the directory you 
          installed Thunderbird into (you will need write permission):
          <p>
            <code>touch .autoreg</code>
          </p>
          <p>The next time you start Thunderbird, GNOME integration should be functional.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
