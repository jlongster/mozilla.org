         enhancements</a> found in Thunderbird&nbsp;3, as well as
        <a href="#issues">known issues</a> and <a href="#FAQ">frequently asked

  <h2 id="whatsnew">What's New in Thunderbird&nbsp;3&nbsp;</h2>
  <p>Thunderbird&nbsp;3  is based on the Gecko 1.9.1.5 platform
        including some major re-architecting to provide improved performance,
        stability, web compatibility, and code simplification and sustainability.      </p>
  <p>There are over 100 changes in this release, many laying the groundwork
        for future changes. Some notable changes include:</p>
        <h3 id="performance2">New Search with Advanced Filtering Tools</h3>
        <ul class="spaced">
          <li>New Search with Advanced Filtering Tools
            <p>Search results now include advanced filtering tools. You have the option to filter your results by sender, tag, attachments, people, folder, and mailing list. You can also filter your email using the timeline tool.</p>
          </li>
          <li>New Global Search Field with Autocomplete
            <p>When typing in the Global Search field, Thunderbird autocompletes against your address book. You have the option of searching everywhere or filtering against different parts of the email such as by subject or by sender.</p>
          </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>User Experience Improvements </h3>
  <ul class="spaced"><li>New Mail Account Setup Wizard
      <p>The new Mail Account Setup Wizard matches against a database of email settings from popular mail providers so that you will only need to provide your name, email, and password to set up new mail accounts. </p>
    </li>
    <li>Redesigned Mail Toolbar
      <p>The Mail Toolbar is redesigned to include the new Global Search bar. Buttons such as reply, forward, delete, junk are part of each email message. You can add those buttons back to the main toolbar by customizing the toolbar.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Tabbed Email
      Messages
      <p>Double-clicking or hitting enter on a mail message will now open that message in a New Tab window. Middle-clicking on messages or folders will open them in a Tab in the background. When quitting Thunderbird, visible tabs will be saved and will be restored when you open Thunderbird the next time. There is also a new Tab menu on the Tab toolbar to help you switch between Tabs. </p>
    </li>
    <li>Smart Folders
      <p>The folder pane offers a Smart Folders mode which combines special mailboxes, like Inbox, from multiple accounts. Smart Folders is now on by default. </p>
    </li>
    <li>New Message Summary
      View
      <p>Selecting multiple messages will give you a summary view of the emails you have selected. </p>
    </li>
    <li>Column Headings
      <p>The column headings that are displayed and the order in which they are displayed can now be set on a per-folder basis.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Message Archive
      <p>You can now file messages from your Inbox or other folders into the new Archive folder system. </p>
    </li>
    <li>Activity Manager
      <p>The Activity Manager records all the interactions between Thunderbird and your email provider in one place.</p>
    </li>
    <li>New Add-ons Manager
      <p>The new Add-ons Manager (Tools &gt; Add-ons) can now be used to find, download, and install Thunderbird Add-ons which includes Extensions, Themes, and Plugins. Note that few Add-ons are compatible with this beta at the time of release, as Add-on developers need to upgrade them.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Improved Address Book
      <p>If someone is in your address book, it is indicated by a new star icon which you can click to edit contact details inline.  If they are not in your address book, you can add them with one click of the icon.  A new birthday field allows you to keep track of your friends' birthdays. You can also add a photo for contacts in your address book.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Improved Gmail Integration
      <p>Better recognition and integration of Gmail's special folders such as Sent and Trash including non-English versions of Gmail. Thunderbird also uses All Mail as the Archives folder.</p>
    </li>
    <li>For Windows Vista users, Thunderbird 3 is now integrated with Vista search results.  On first start, Thunderbird will prompt
      to install its indexing system into Windows Vista and you can choose to see Thunderbird email and news
      messages in Windows search results. </li>
  </ul>
  <ul class="spaced">
    <li> For Mac users,&nbsp;Thunderbird 3 is now integrated with Spotlight, can import from Mail.app,
      read your OS X address book, and use Growl for new mail alerts. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Performance Improvements</h3>
  <ul class="spaced">
    <li>IMAP Folder Synchronization
      <p>Thunderbird will download IMAP messages by default in the background to allow for faster message loading and better offline operation. This feature can be enabled on an individual folder basis via Folder properties, or for all folders in an account via Account Settings / 'Synchronize &amp; Storage'.</p>
          </li>
  </ul>
<h2 id="downloadandinstall">Downloading and Installing</h2>

      <h3 id="requirements">System Requirements</h3>

      <p>Before installing, make sure your computer meets the <a href="../../system-requirements/prerelease.html">

         system requirements</a>.</p>
      <p>Please note that Thunderbird&nbsp;3 no longer supports versions of Windows prior to Windows 2000 (e.g. Windows 95, 98, ME and NT)  and Mac OS X versions prior to 10.4 Tiger. Linux requirements have also changed. Do ensure that compatibility mode for unsupported Windows platforms is disabled for the Thunderbird executable in Windows.</p>
  <h3 id="download">Downloading Thunderbird&nbsp;3&nbsp;</h3>
<p>
      Mozilla Messaging provides Thunderbird&nbsp;3&nbsp;for Windows, Linux, and Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X in a
         variety of languages. You can <a href="../../early_releases/downloads/">get
         the latest release candidate of Thunderbird 3 here</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="install">Installing Thunderbird&nbsp;3&nbsp;</h3>
  <p>Please note that installing Thunderbird&nbsp;3 <em>may overwrite</em> your
         existing installation of Thunderbird on Linux. Windows and Mac OS X will install to different locations, however
         it is recommended that you check the messages during installation. For all systems, you won't lose 
         any of your messages or address books, but some of your extensions and other add-ons might 
         not work until updates for them are made available.</p>
         
  <p>Users are highly encouraged to install Thunderbird&nbsp;3 in another folder (on Windows, this is done using Custom Install) and backup their profiles before testing Thunderbird&nbsp;3.</p>

    <h3 id="uninstall">Removing Thunderbird&nbsp;3&nbsp;</h3>

  <p>You can remove Thunderbird&nbsp;3 through the <tt>Control Panel</tt> in the
         <tt>Start Menu</tt> on Windows, by removing the <tt>Thunderbird</tt> application on 
         OS X, or by removing the <tt>thunderbird</tt> folder on Linux.</p>

  <p>Removing Thunderbird&nbsp;3 won't remove your emails or newsgroup messages. This data is stored in your <em>profile
         folder</em>, which is located in one of the following locations depending on
         your operating system:</p>

<table style="font-size: small;" border="1" cellspacing="0">
        <tr>
          <td>Windows Vista</td>
          <td>Users\&lt;UserName&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Windows 2000, XP, Server 2003</td>
          <td>Documents and Settings\&lt;UserName&gt;\Application Data\Thunderbird</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

          <td>Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X</td>
          <td>~/Library/Thunderbird</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Linux and Unix systems</td>

          <td>~/.thunderbird</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Any version of Thunderbird that you install after removing Thunderbird&nbsp;3 will
         continue to use the data from this profile folder.</p>

  <h3 id="extensions">Extensions and Themes</h3>

      <p>
        Extensions installed under previous versions of Thunderbird may be incompatible and/or require
        updates to work with Thunderbird&nbsp;3. Please report any issues to the
        maintainer of the extension.</p>

  <p>When you install Thunderbird&nbsp;3 all of your Extensions and Themes will be
        disabled until Thunderbird&nbsp;3 determines that either a) they are compatible
        with the Thunderbird&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;4 release or b) there are newer versions available that
        are compatible.</p>

  <h2 id="issues">Known Issues</h2>

      <p>This list covers some of the known problems with Thunderbird&nbsp;3. Please read 
         this before reporting any new bugs.</p>
      <dl>

      <dt id="allsystems">All Systems</dt>
      <dd>
        <ul class="spaced">
          
          <li>If you use or had previously used the master password feature, you may be prompted to enter your master password when you first start up Thunderbird. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=338549">Bug 338549</a>)</li>
          <li>Your passwords are stored in a new location. If you go back to using a previous version of Thunderbird, or switch back and forth between Thunderbird 3 and an older version, your password lists do not get updated.</li>
          <li>Searching your emails is case sensitive for languages other than English. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=525537">Bug 525537</a>)</li>
          <li>If using SSL or TLS, and the certificate that
           comes from the server is self-signed, expired, or has a domain that
           does not match the server domain, a dialog will be shown asking if
           Thunderbird should permanently make an exception for the cert.
          This should only be done if the error is understood. </li>
          <li>The extended columns in the folder pane were
          removed in Beta 1. There is an <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/9716">add-on</a> that restores this functionality. </li>
          <li>The compact header view was removed in Beta 3 (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=480623">Bug 480623</a>); see <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/dmose/archives/2009/07/thunderbird_30b3_shipped.html">this blog entry</a> for details.</li>
          <li>Some Thunderbird 2 users upgrading to Thunderbird 3 may not be able to login to their smtp server because the secure authentication setting maybe turned on but not supported by the smtp server. Check your smtp server settings in Tools -&gt; Account Settings -&gt; Outgoing Server, and edit the smtp server with the issue. If use 'secure authentication' is checked, uncheck it and try again. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=522633">Bug 522633</a>)</li>
          <li>Thunderbird requires that extensions either come from a secure server using the HTTPS protocol or are digitally signed, or they will fail to install.</li>

  <h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>

      <ul class="spaced">
        <li>
          Poorly designed or incompatible extensions can cause problems with your email client, including make it crash, slow down message display, etc. If you encounter strange problems relating to parts of the email client no longer working, the email client not starting, windows with strange or distorted appearance, degraded performance, etc, you may be suffering from Extension or Theme trouble.
          Restart the email client in Safe Mode. On Windows, start using the &quot;Safe Mode&quot; shortcut created in your
          Start menu or by running <code>thunderbird.exe -safe-mode</code>. On Linux, 
          start with <code>./thunderbird -safe-mode</code> and on Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X, run:
          <p><code>

            cd /Applications/Thunderbird.app/Contents/MacOS/<br />
            ./thunderbird-bin -safe-mode
          </code></p>

          When started in Safe Mode all extensions are disabled and the Default theme is used. Disable the Extension/Theme that is causing trouble and then start normally.        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If you encounter strange problems relating to email, feeds or newsgroup messages, it is recommended that you try
          creating a new profile and attempting to reproduce the problem before filing
          bugs. Create a new profile by running Thunderbird with the -P command line
          argument, choose the &quot;Manage Profiles&quot; button and then choose &quot;Create
          Profile...&quot;. Migrate your settings files (Emails, feeds, etc) over
          one by one, checking each time to see if the problems resurface. If you do
          find a particular profile data file is causing a problem, file a bug and attach
          the file, being sure to remove any private information as necessary.</p>
