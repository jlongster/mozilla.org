     before the final release. They may come with crashes and bugs and may
     potentially cause data loss in profiles (configuration data, preferences,
     and downloaded mail). </p>

   <p><strong>Please do not use Thunderbird&nbsp;3 Beta&nbsp;3 in a production
      environment.</strong></p>

         enhancements</a> found in Thunderbird&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;3, as well as

    <h2 id="whatsnew">What's New in Thunderbird&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;3</h2>
    <p>Thunderbird&nbsp;3 Beta&nbsp;3 is based on the Gecko 1.9.1.1 platform
        including some major re-architecting to provide improved performance,
        stability, web compatibility, and code simplification and sustainability.      </p>
  <p>There are over 500 changes in this release, many laying the groundwork
        for future changes. Some notable changes include:</p>
        <h3 id="performance2">Developer Improvements</h3>
        <ul class="spaced"><li>Thread Pane and Tab Refactoring
          <p>See <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.apps.thunderbird/browse_thread/thread/93372c8b9a4e32a2/ef9aa309b8b99ab9?q=%22UI+refactoring+on+bug+474701%22#ef9aa309b8b99ab9">Thread Pane UI refactoring discussion</a> for additional details.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Fixes For Extension Developers
            <p>See <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Extensions/Thunderbird">Thunderbird Extensions</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Extensions/Thunderbird/HowTos">Thunderbird HowTos</a> for developer documentation.</p>
          </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>User Experience Improvements</h3>
<ul class="spaced">
<li>Tabbed Email
            Messages
              <p>Double-clicking or hitting enter on a mail message will now open that message in a New Tab window. Middle-clicking on messages or folders will open them in a Tab in the background. When quitting Thunderbird, visible tabs will be saved and will be restored when you open Thunderbird the next time. There is also a new Tab menu on the Tab toolbar to help you switch between Tabs. </p>
    </li>
          <li>New Message Summary
            View
            <p>Selecting multiple messages will give you a summary view of the emails you have selected. </p>
          </li>
          <li>Column Headings
            <p>The column headings that are displayed and the order in which they are displayed can now be set on a per-folder basis.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Smart Folders
            <p>The folder pane offers a Smart Folders mode which combines special mailboxes (e.g. Inbox) from multiple accounts together.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Improved Gmail Integration
            <p>Better recognition and integration of Gmail's special folders such as Sent and Trash including non-English versions of Gmail. Thunderbird also uses All Mail as the Archives folder.</p>
          </li>
</ul>


<p>
   We are also testing an early version of a new Mail Account Setup Wizard to
   make configuring e-mail accounts in Thunderbird easier and less error-prone.
   Learn about how this is implemented and how it has been carefully designed
   with your privacy in mind, by taking the the time to read

<h2 id="downloadandinstall">Downloading and Installing</h2>

      <h3 id="requirements">System Requirements</h3>

      <p>Before installing, make sure your computer meets the <a href="../../system-requirements/prerelease.html">

         system requirements</a>.</p>
      <p>Please note that Thunderbird&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;3 no longer supports versions of Windows prior to Windows 2000 (e.g. Windows 95, 98, ME and NT)  and Mac OS X versions prior to 10.4 Tiger. Linux requirements have also changed. Do ensure that compatibility mode for unsupported Windows platforms is disabled for the Thunderbird executable in Windows.</p>
    <h3 id="download">Downloading Thunderbird&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;3</h3>
    <p>
      Mozilla Messaging provides Thunderbird&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;3 for Windows, Linux, and Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X in a
         variety of languages. You can <a href="../../early_releases/downloads/">get
         the latest beta version of Thunderbird 3 here</a>.</p>

    <h3 id="install">Installing Thunderbird&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;3</h3>
    <p>Please note that installing Thunderbird&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;3 <em>may overwrite</em> your
         existing installation of Thunderbird on Linux. Windows and Mac OS X will install to different locations, however
         it is recommended that you check the messages during installation. For all systems, you won't lose 
         any of your messages or address books, but some of your extensions and other add-ons might 
         not work until updates for them are made available.</p>
         
    <p>Users are highly encouraged to install Thunderbird&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;3 in another folder (on Windows, this is done using Custom Install) and backup their profiles before testing Thunderbird&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;3.</p>

    <h3 id="uninstall">Removing Thunderbird&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;3</h3>

    <p>You can remove Thunderbird&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;3 through the <tt>Control Panel</tt> in the
         <tt>Start Menu</tt> on Windows, by removing the <tt>Thunderbird</tt> application on 
         OS X, or by removing the <tt>thunderbird</tt> folder on Linux.</p>

      <p>Removing Thunderbird&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;3 won't remove your emails or newsgroup messages. This data is stored in your <em>profile
         folder</em>, which is located in one of the following locations depending on
         your operating system:</p>

      <table style="font-size: small;" border="1" cellspacing="0">
        <tr>
          <td>Windows Vista</td>
          <td>Users\&lt;UserName&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Windows 2000, XP, Server 2003</td>
          <td>Documents and Settings\&lt;UserName&gt;\Application Data\Thunderbird</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

          <td>Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X</td>
          <td>~/Library/Thunderbird</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Linux and Unix systems</td>

          <td>~/.thunderbird</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Any version of Thunderbird that you install after removing Thunderbird&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;3 will
         continue to use the data from this profile folder.</p>

      <h3 id="extensions">Extensions and Themes</h3>

      <p>
        Extensions installed under previous versions of Thunderbird may be incompatible and/or require
        updates to work with Thunderbird&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;3. Please report any issues to the
        maintainer of the extension.</p>

      <p>When you install Thunderbird&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;3 all of your Extensions and Themes will be
        disabled until Thunderbird&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;3 determines that either a) they are compatible
        with the Thunderbird&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;3 release or b) there are newer versions available that
        are compatible.</p>

  <h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>

      <ul class="spaced">
        <li>
          Poorly designed or incompatible extensions can cause problems with your email client, including make it crash, slow down message display, etc. If you encounter strange problems relating to parts of the email client no longer working, the email client not starting, windows with strange or distorted appearance, degraded performance, etc, you may be suffering from Extension or Theme trouble.
          Restart the email client in Safe Mode. On Windows, start using the &quot;Safe Mode&quot; shortcut created in your
          Start menu or by running <code>thunderbird.exe -safe-mode</code>. On Linux, 
          start with <code>./thunderbird -safe-mode</code> and on Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X, run:
          <p><code>

            cd /Applications/Thunderbird.app/Contents/MacOS/<br />
            ./thunderbird-bin -safe-mode
          </code></p>

          When started in Safe Mode all extensions are disabled and the Default theme is used. Disable the Extension/Theme that is causing trouble and then start normally.        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If you encounter strange problems relating to email, feeds or newsgroup messages, it is recommended that you try
          creating a new profile and attempting to reproduce the problem before filing
          bugs. Create a new profile by running Thunderbird with the -P command line
          argument, choose the &quot;Manage Profiles&quot; button and then choose &quot;Create
          Profile...&quot;. Migrate your settings files (Emails, feeds, etc) over
          one by one, checking each time to see if the problems resurface. If you do
          find a particular profile data file is causing a problem, file a bug and attach
          the file, being sure to remove any private information as necessary.</p>
