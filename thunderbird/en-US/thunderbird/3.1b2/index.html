      <p>Thunderbird 3.1 Beta 2, <a href="../early_releases/downloads/">available now for download</a>, is built on top of the Gecko 1.9.2 platform. While this milestone is considered to be stable, it is intended for developers and members of our testing community to use for evaluation and feedback. Users of this latest alpha version of Thunderbird should not expect all of their add-ons to work properly with this milestone. </p>
      <p>The main goals of this release is to find out about possible problems
        caused by the changes in the underlying platform.  Notable changes include:</p>
      <ul class="spaced">
        <li>New quick filter toolbar.</li>
        <li>New migration assistant.</li>
        <li>Improved support for Personas.</li>
        <li>Several fixes to improve upgrading from Thunderbird 2.</li>
        <li>Several design improvements and corrections to the interface.</li>
        <li>Stability and memory improvements.</li>
      </ul>
