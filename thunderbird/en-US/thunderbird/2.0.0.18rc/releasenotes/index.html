    <h1>Thunderbird Community Beta Program</h1>

    <p>During the run up to Thunderbird 2, we released beta builds and 
       release candidates for wide testing and feedback as part of 
       a community beta program. Anyone who downloaded and installed 
       these pre-release versions of Thunderbird became part of this beta 
       program and was automatically updated to the Thunderbird 2 final
       release.</p>

    <p>To ensure continued improvement in the quality of Thunderbird 2,
       we are now applying the same program to our security and
       stability release process for Thunderbird 2. Starting within the
       next 24 hours, everyone who participated in the beta process
       will be offered a pre-release version of the next security and
       stability update.</p>

    <p>If you are participating in this program, thanks for your 
       continued help. Please report any problems or issues at our
       community feedback web site at
       <a href="http://feedback.mozilla.org/">http://feedback.mozilla.org</a> 
       or through the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.feedback.thunderbird.prerelease">
       mozilla.feedback.thunderbird.prerelease</a> newsgroup.</p>

    <p>The final release of Thunderbird 2.0.0.18 will take place shortly
       after we complete wide testing through this program. All
       press inquiries should be directed to
       <a href="mailto:press@mozilla.com">press@mozilla.com</a>.</p>

    <p>To exclude yourself from the beta program, simply download and  
       install the latest stable production release of Thunderbird from
       <a href="http://www.getthunderbird.com/">http://getthunderbird.com</a>.</p>

    <p>In the near future, we will be accepting additional people into  
       this community beta program. More information on how to join 
       will be posted soon to
       <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/devnews/">http://developer.mozilla.org/devnews/</a>.</p>

    <p><b>Technical Note:</b> You can identify if you are part of the 
       beta program by following these instructions:</p>
    <ol>
       <li>Launch Thunderbird.</li>
       <li>Navigate in Thunderbird to 'Tools' -> 'Options' -> 'Advanced' -> 'General' -> 'Config Editor' (button).</li>
       <li>In the Filter field, enter: <tt>app.update.channel</tt>
           then press the enter key.</li>
       <li>If you see the value <tt>app.update.channel</tt> set to
           "beta", you are enrolled in the beta program. 
           (Note: The effective value cannot be changed through the Config Editor.
           If you wish to exclude yourself from the beta program you must download 
           and install the latest production release as mentioned above.)</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="downloadandinstall">Downloading and Installing</h2>

    <h3 id="requirements">System Requirements</h3>
    <p>Before installing, make sure your computer meets the <a href="/<?=$lang?>/thunderbird/system-requirements.html">system requirements</a>.</p>

    <h3 id="download">Downloading Thunderbird&nbsp;2</h3>
    <p>Mozilla provides Thunderbird&nbsp;2 for Windows, Linux, and Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X in a variety of languages. You can <a href="/<?=$lang?>/thunderbird/all.html">get the latest version of Thunderbird&nbsp;2 here</a>.</p>
    <p>For builds for other systems and languages not provided by Mozilla.org, see the Contributed Builds section at the end of this document.</p>

    <h3 id="install">Installing Thunderbird&nbsp;2</h3>
    <p>Please note that installing Thunderbird&nbsp;2 <em>will overwrite</em> your existing installation of Thunderbird. You won't lose any of your mail, but some of your extensions and other add-ons might not work until updates for them are made available.</p>

    <h3 id="uninstall">Uninstalling Thunderbird&nbsp;2</h3>
    <p>You can remove Thunderbird&nbsp;2 through the <tt>Control Panel</tt> in the <tt>Start Menu</tt> on Windows, by removing the <tt>Thunderbird</tt> application on OS X, or by removing the <tt>thunderbird</tt> folder on Linux.</p>
    <p>Removing Thunderbird&nbsp;2 won't remove your email messages, extensions or other add-ons. This data is stored in your <em>profile folder</em>, which is located in one of the following locations depending on your operating system:</p>

    <table style="font-size: small;" border="1" cellspacing="0">
      <tr>
        <td>Windows Vista</td>
        <td>Users\&lt;UserName&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Windows 2000, XP</td>
        <td>Documents and Settings\&lt;UserName&gt;\Application Data\Thunderbird</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Windows NT</td>
        <td>WINNT\Profiles\&lt;UserName&gt;\Application Data\Thunderbird</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Windows 98, ME</td>
        <td>Windows\Application Data\Thunderbird</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X</td>
        <td>~/Library/Thunderbird</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Linux and Unix systems</td>
        <td>~/.thunderbird</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>Any version of Thunderbird that you install after removing Thunderbird&nbsp;2 will continue to use the data from this profile folder.</p>

    <h3 id="extensions">Extensions and Themes</h3>
    <p>Extensions installed under Thunderbird 1.5 may be incompatible and/or require updates to work with Thunderbird&nbsp;2. Please report any issues to the maintainer of the extension.  When you install Thunderbird&nbsp;2 all of your Extensions and Themes will be disabled until Thunderbird&nbsp;2 determines that either a) they are compatible with the Thunderbird&nbsp;2 release or b) there are newer versions available that are compatible.</p>

    <h2 id="issues">Known Issues</h2>
    <p>This list covers some of the known problems with Thunderbird&nbsp;2. Please read this before reporting any new bugs.</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>All Systems</dt>
      <dd>
        <ul class="spaced">
          <li>If you were using the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/thunderbird/addon/106">Buttons! Extension</a> with Thunderbird 1.5.0.x and then upgraded to Thunderbird 2,
              you will see a gray box at the bottom of the main Thunderbird window containing the text:  "----------------^&lt;menuitem". To fix this problem disable or download the 
              latest version of the Buttons! extension.</li>
          <li>If you were using the ScheduleWorld extension with Thunderbird 1.5.0.x and your folders disappeared when you updated to Thunderbird 2, please disable this extension and restart Thunderbird.
              Your folders should now show up again.</li>
          <li>Some firewall software may silently block Thunderbird from running. This often happens immediately after Thunderbird has been installed or updated from a previous version. There are <a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Firewalls">configuration instructions</a> available for most popular firewall programs to help you ensure that Thunderbird is allowed to connect to the Internet.</li>
          <li>Software Update will not work if Thunderbird is installed to a location on your disk to which you do not have write access, since Software Update needs to replace or create files in this location.</li>
          <li>Dictionaries can be installed as extensions from: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/thunderbird/dictionaries/?lang=<?=$lang?>">addons.mozilla.org</a>.</li>
          <li>The mail views toolbar button is no longer a default toolbar button. Users of this feature must add it back to their default toolbar in the mail 3-pane window: View / Toolbars / Customize.</li>
          <li>In order to take advantage of Thunderbird's ability to adjust the online state based on your network connectivity, you must first change the value of <tt>network.autodial-helper.enabled</tt> to false.</li>
          <li>When switching between using a Global Inbox and using an Inbox for a POP3 account, be sure to make copies of the messages into another folder.</li>
          <li>A compatible version of DOM Inspector is now available for Extension and Theme developers at: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/thunderbird/1806/">https://addons.mozilla.org/thunderbird/1806/</a>.</li>

          <li>Users with NVIDIA RIVA TNT2 or GeForce2 based graphics cards may see overlapping or garbled text in the message list pane. This is caused by a bug
              in the NVIDIA drivers. You can fix this by: upgrading your NVIDIA video driver OR turning down hardware acceleration one level by going to Control Panel -> Display -> Settings -> Advanced -> Troubleshooting
              OR downloading this <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/thunderbird/addon/5204">extension for Thunderbird</a> which works around the problem.</li>

    <h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
    <ul class="spaced">
      <li>Occasionally, Extensions may cause problems with Thunderbird, including reduced stability and performance. If you encounter problems relating to parts of the mail client no longer working, the mail client not starting, windows with strange or distorted appearance, degraded performance, etc., you may be suffering from Extension or Theme trouble. Restart the mail client in Safe Mode. On Windows, start using the "Safe Mode" shortcut created in your Start menu or by running <code>thunderbird.exe -safe-mode</code>. On Linux, start with <code>./thunderbird -safe-mode</code> and on Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X, run:
        <p><code>
          cd /Applications/Thunderbird.app/Contents/MacOS/<br />
          ./thunderbird-bin -safe-mode
        </code></p>
      When started in Safe Mode all extensions are disabled and the Default theme is used. Disable the Extension/Theme that is causing trouble and then start normally.</li>
