    <p class="intro">We build public benefit into the Internet by creating free, open source products and technologies that improve the online experience for people everywhere. We work in the open under the umbrella of the non-profit Mozilla Foundation. Everything we create is a public asset available for others to use, adapt, and improve. </p>

	<h3>What is Mozilla?</h3>
	<p>We're a global community of thousands who sincerely believe in the power of the technology to enrich people's lives.</p>
	<p>We're a public benefit organization dedicated not to making money but to improving the way people everywhere experience the Internet.</p>
	<p>And, we're an open source software project whose code has been used as a platform for some of the Internet's most innovative projects.</p>
	<p>In the end, the Mozilla community, organization and technology is all focused on a single goal: making the Internet better for everyone. </p>
	<h3>The Thunderbird Vision</h3>
	<p>Thunderbird, as a messaging system, is uniquely positioned as the tool that users can use to integrate as many of their communications as they want.</p>
	<p>By combining an open architecture, a powerful extensibility and customization framework, and a person-centric perspective on communications, Thunderbird is a powerful yet enjoyable tool to help individuals manage their online interactions -- whether that’s email, instant messaging, social networking messages, or other types of message.</p>
	<p>Thunderbird will evolve to embrace the Web, by continuing to blur the distinction between what’s on the web and what’s on the desktop, while keeping in mind the importance of keeping the individual in charge of their online experience.</p>
