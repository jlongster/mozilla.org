  <h2 id="downloadandinstall">Downloading and Installing</h2>

      <h3 id="requirements">System Requirements</h3>

      <p>Before installing, make sure your computer meets the system requirements.</p>
      <p>Please note that Lanikai Alpha 1 no longer supports versions of Windows prior to Windows 2000 (e.g. Windows 95, 98, ME, and NT) and Mac OS X versions prior to 10.4 Tiger. Linux requirements have also changed. Do ensure that compatibility mode for unsupported Windows platforms is disabled for the Thunderbird executable in Windows.</p>
      <h3 id="download">Downloading Lanikai Alpha 1</h3>
      <p>Mozilla Messaging provides Lanikai Alpha 1 for Windows, Linux, and Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X in a
         variety of languages. You can <a href="../../early_releases/downloads/">get
         the latest alpha version of Lanikai here</a>.</p>

      <h3 id="install">Installing Lanikai Alpha 1</h3>
      <p>Please note that installing Lanikai Alpha 1 <em>may overwrite</em> your
         existing installation of Thunderbird on Linux. Windows and Mac OS X will install to different locations, however
         it is recommended that you check the messages during installation. For all systems, you won't lose 
         any of your messages or address books, but some of your extensions and other add-ons might 
         not work until updates for them are made available.</p>
         
      <p>Users are highly encouraged to install Lanikai Alpha 1 in another folder (on Windows, this is done using Custom Install) and backup their profiles before testing Lanikai Alpha 1.</p>

      <h3 id="uninstall">Removing Lanikai Alpha 1</h3>

      <p>You can remove Lanikai Alpha 1 through the <tt>Control Panel</tt> in the
         <tt>Start Menu</tt> on Windows, by removing the <tt>Lanikai</tt> application on 
         OS X, or by removing the <tt>thunderbird</tt> folder on Linux.</p>

      <p>Removing Lanikai Alpha&nbsp;1 won't remove your emails or newsgroup messages. This data is stored in your <em>profile
         folder</em>, which is located in one of the following locations depending on
         your operating system:</p>

      <table style="font-size: small;" border="1" cellspacing="0">
        <tr>
          <td>Windows Vista</td>
          <td>Users\&lt;UserName&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Windows 2000, XP, Server 2003</td>
          <td>Documents and Settings\&lt;UserName&gt;\Application Data\Thunderbird</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

          <td>Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X</td>
          <td>~/Library/Thunderbird</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Linux and Unix systems</td>

          <td>~/.thunderbird</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Any version of Thunderbird that you install after removing Lanikai Alpha 1 will
         continue to use the data from this profile folder.</p>

      <h3 id="extensions">Extensions and Themes</h3>

      <p>Extensions installed under previous versions of Thunderbird may be incompatible and/or require 
         updates to work with Lanikai Alpha 1. Please report any issues to the 
         maintainer of the extension.</p>

      <p>When you install Lanikai Alpha 1 all of your Extensions and Themes will be 
         disabled until Lanikai Alpha 1 determines that either a) they are compatible 
         with the Lanikai Alpha 1 release or b) there are newer versions available that 
         are compatible.</p>

          <ul class="spaced">
            <li>If you are using the Kaspersky Anti-Spam Extension, it is disabled in Lanikai Alpha 1. The Kaspersky Anti-Spam Extension will support Thunderbird 3 in their next version. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=533692">Bug 533692</a>)</li>
            <li>If you use or had previously used the master password feature, you may be prompted to enter your master password when you first start up Lanikai. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=338549">Bug 338549</a>)</li>
            <li>Your passwords are stored in a new location. If you go back to using a Thunderbird 2, or switch back and forth between Lanikai and Thunderbird 2, your password lists do not get updated.</li>
            <li>Searching your emails is case sensitive for languages other than English. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=525537">Bug 525537</a>)</li>
            <li>If using SSL or TLS, and the certificate that
              comes from the server is self-signed, expired, or has a domain that
              does not match the server domain, a dialog will be shown asking if
              Thunderbird should permanently make an exception for the cert.
              This should only be done if the error is understood. </li>
            <li>The extended columns in the folder pane were
              removed in Thunderbird 3 Beta 1. There is an <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/9716">add-on</a> that restores this functionality. </li>
            <li>The compact header view was removed in Thundebird 3 Beta 3 (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=480623">Bug 480623</a>); see <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/dmose/archives/2009/07/thunderbird_30b3_shipped.html">this blog entry</a> for details. There is an <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/13564">extension</a> that offers similar functionality.</li>
            <li>Some Thunderbird 2 users upgrading to Lanikai may not be able to login to their smtp server because the secure authentication setting maybe turned on but not supported by the smtp server. Check your smtp server settings in Tools -&gt; Account Settings -&gt; Outgoing Server, and edit the smtp server with the issue. If use 'secure authentication' is checked, uncheck it and try again. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=522633">Bug 522633</a>)</li>
            <li>Lanikai requires that extensions either come from a secure server using the HTTPS protocol or are digitally signed, or they will fail to install.</li>
            <li>If you are unable to view content for your RSS feeds in the Wide View Layout, you may need to disable the Lightning Calendar add-on if you have it installed or switch to Classic View and restart Thunderbird. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=531397">Bug 531397</a>)</li>
            <li>Some emails sent in Plain Text may move the message and some of the buttons out of the message pane. Open the message in a New Tab, resize the window, or change your layout to Classic View or Wide View to view the message. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=530047">Bug 530047</a>)</li>
            <li>When working Offline, if you compose an email and select 'Send Later', your message may not be sent if you reconnect automatically to the Internet. You will need need to manually resend the email from your Drafts folder. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=531179">Bug 531179</a>)</li>
            <li>In some cases, using 'Save As Template' from the File menu may not work. You can still Save As Template from the email Compose window or drag the message into the Template folder. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=532050">Bug 532050</a>)</li>

    <h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>

      <ul class="spaced">
        <li>
          Poorly designed or incompatible extensions can cause problems with your email client, including make it crash, slow down message display, etc. If you encounter strange problems relating to parts of the email client no longer working, the email client not starting, windows with strange or distorted appearance, degraded performance, etc, you may be suffering from Extension or Theme trouble.
          Restart the email client in Safe Mode. On Windows, start using the &quot;Safe Mode&quot; shortcut created in your
          Start menu or by running <code>thunderbird.exe -safe-mode</code>. On Linux, 
          start with <code>./thunderbird -safe-mode</code> and on Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X, run:
          <p><code>

            cd /Applications/Thunderbird.app/Contents/MacOS/<br />
            ./thunderbird-bin -safe-mode
          </code></p>

          When started in Safe Mode all extensions are disabled and the Default theme is used. Disable the Extension/Theme that is causing trouble and then start normally.        </li>
        <li>
          If you encounter strange problems relating to email, feeds or newsgroup messages, it is recommended that you try
          creating a new profile and attempting to reproduce the problem before filing
          bugs. Create a new profile by running Thunderbird with the -P command line
          argument, choose the &quot;Manage Profiles&quot; button and then choose &quot;Create
          Profile...&quot;. Migrate your settings files (Emails, feeds, etc) over
          one by one, checking each time to see if the problems resurface. If you do
          find a particular profile data file is causing a problem, file a bug and attach
          the file, being sure to remove any private information as necessary.</li>
