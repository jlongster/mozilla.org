<h2>What's New in Thunderbird 3.1</h2>

<p>We hope you enjoy the new features in Thunderbird. We have new search tools, tabbed email, message archiving, and hundreds of add-ons to make Thunderbird 3.1 all yours. </p>

<h2>Easier to Upgrade with New Migration Assistant</h2>

<p>Under the Help Menu, select the Migration Assistant to help you change your Toolbar layout and add features like Compact Header and Advanced Folder Columns. </p>

<h2>Better Search with New Search Tools</h2>

<p>The new Quick Filter Toolbar lets you filter your email faster. Filter your email by New Messages, Tags, people in your Address Book, or using search terms. You can also &quot;Pin&quot; or save a Filter and use it across multiple folders. </p>

<p>Type in your search term in the Global Search Bar and we will open your search results in a new tab. You can pinpoint what you're looking for with Thunderbird's filtering and timeline tools. </p>

<h2>Tabbed Email</h2>

<p>If you like Firefox’s tabbed browsing, you’re going to love tabbed email. Double-click or hit enter on a mail message to open messages in a new tab window. You can right-click on messages or folders to open them in a tab background.</p>

<h2>Message Archiving</h2>

<p>Clicking the Archive button or  the ‘A’ key will archive your email. Archiving mail moves email from your inbox into the new archive folder system.</p>
