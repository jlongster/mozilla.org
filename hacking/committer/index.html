    <p>This document outlines the procedure for getting commit access to the Mozilla Foundation repositories.</p>

    <p>In all cases, you need to demonstrate you know what's going on, find a <a href="../commit-access-policy/">person or
    people who have adequate authority</a> and will vouch for your competence, and complete
    and sign a Committer's Agreement.</p>
    
    <h2 id="procedure">Procedure</h2>
    
    <p>Here is a list of the steps that need to happen to become a 
    Mozilla committer. Employment with
    any particular entity (including the Mozilla Foundation or Corporation) does not change the need
    to follow these steps. </p> 
    
    <ol>
      <li>Read the <a href="../commit-access-policy/">Commit Access Policy</a>, and decide which level of access you need to apply for.
      <li><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=mozilla.org&component=Repository%20Account%20Requests">File a bug</a> in the "Repository Account Requests" component.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Make the bug title of the form "Commit Access (Level X) for Fred Bloggs"</li>
        <li>Say what email address you want to use as your login name</li>
        <li>If you need access to particular trees on the exceptions list, list them</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Attach your SSH <em>public</em> key to the
      bug - a file with extension ".pub". (Please mark it as <code>text/plain</code> when attaching it!)</li>
      <li>Send us a <a href="../notification/">completed Committer's Agreement</a>.</li>
      <li>Update the bug to note that you've sent in the Agreement.</li>
      <li>Get your voucher(s), and/or the owner of the exception tree you want access for, to add a comment to the bug saying
      they support your application.</li>
      <li>An appropriate Mozilla representative will update the bug when they have received your signed Agreement.</li>
      <li>So, to recap, the bug needs:
        <ul>
          <li>Declaration of what level you want and the email address to use
          <li>SSH public key
          <li>Comments from all the necessary vouchers
          <li>Comment from Mozilla that agreement has been received
        </ul>
      <li>When all that is true, add a comment saying "This request is ready for consideration."</li>
      <li>A Mozilla representative will double-check that the needed info is recorded
      and, if so, create an account.</li>
      <li>A Mozilla representative will then reassign the bug to IT to have your SSH
      public key added.</li>
      <li>A Mozilla IT representative will update the bug with account creation
      information and close the bug.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="form">Contributor Form</h2>
    <p>You'll need to fill out and <a href="../notification/">submit</a> the <a href="committers-agreement.pdf">Committer's Agreement</a> 
    (both sections 1 and 6) to get your account set up. Read it carefully - signing it indicates you understand and
    agree to our legal requirements. Breaking these rules could cause legal problems for
    Mozilla and may cause us to revoke your access. If you have any questions, ask
    us.</p>

    <h2 id="vouchers">Vouchers</h2>
    <p>You will need one or more vouchers. The <a href="../commit-access-policy/">Commit Access Policy</a> sets out who is
    allowed to vouch, and it depends on what level of access you are requesting.
    Each voucher must already have 
    commit access and be confident enough in you to be associated with your check-ins.
    Your vouchers are responsible for your bustages in the unfortunate event that you
    break things and leave. They are responsible for making sure you know and follow
    the rules in general, act promptly to fix regressions, are aware of and respect tree
    closures, etc. The vouchers' responsibility extends for three months after you are
    granted source code commit access. If you've lived in the tree without significant
    issues for three months, we assume you're ready to stand on your own. If somehow
    there are persistent problems during the first three months, the vouchers have the
    authority to request revocation of your access during this period. Vouching is a big
    responsibility, so people will make this commitment only after due consideration. A
    voucher who helps people who aren't prepared get access to the source tree will find
    that his or her own credibility suffers as well.</p>

    <h2 id="revoking-commit-access">Revoking Commit Access</h2>
    <p>If someone consistently causes difficulties with these source repositories due to
    poor behavior or other serious problems then commit access may be revoked. We have no
    precise process for this as it has been a rare or nonexistent problem to date. The
    process for this is for one or more committers with concerns to notify the owner of
    the Commit Access Policy sub-module if you have clear examples of someone whom you
    believe has reached this level of problem. Do not do so carelessly, or based on
    passing irritation or without a sense that you are not alone in your concerns. The
    Commit Access Policy owner will investigate or cause an investigation to occur,
    privately at first and perhaps completely privately.</p> 

    <h2 id="dormant-accounts">Dormant Accounts</h2>
    <p>If your account in a particular SCM is inactive for more than 6 months, it
    may be deactivated. However, the knowledge that you have achieved a particular
    level of access is retained. Therefore, getting your account reactivated is a 
    simple matter of filing a bug asking IT to turn it back on. Such bugs should
    be dealt with extremely quickly.</p>

    <h2 id="problems">Problems With Your Account</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Need to hear a <a href= 
      "ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mozilla/libraries/bonus-tracks/rheet.wav">rheeet</a>?</li>
      <li>If you find that someone is using your account, 
      <a href="../notification/">notify us of the problem</a>.</li>
      <li>If you need help with CVS-over-SSH, see <a href="/cvs-ssh-faq.html">our guide
      to setting up access to cvs.mozilla.org using SSH</a>.</li>
      <li>And we have a document on  
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Mercurial_FAQ#How_do_I_check_stuff_in.3f">checking in using Hg</a> too.</li>
